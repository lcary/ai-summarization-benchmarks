If a German Shepherd is left a lone for long periods of time it will likely become bored and destructive. For example, the dog may start barking, chewing things, or digging. Make sure that your German Shepherd receives at least 1 hour of exercise each day. This breed is highly intelligent and trainable. They like to have a job or task to do, and you can train a German Shepherd to do a variety of different jobs. For example, German Shepherd's are often used as \"working\" dogs, helping with search and rescue, drug sniffing and security, as well as providing aide and assistance to the visibly impaired.

A pet can guard when he knows what all belongs to him and what does not. This ability helps a German Shepherd to differentiate between an enemy and the family.

A severe sore throat, swollen mucus membranes that are streaked with white pus, fever and malaise are all signs of an infection. However, only bacterial infections are impacted by antibiotics, so your doctor will likely swab your throat and determine if the infection is bacterial, viral or fungal.  If bacteria is the culprit (strep throat is a relatively common cause of laryngitis), then your doctor may prescribe a two week course of antibiotics, such as Amoxicillin or Erythromycin. Follow the doctor's instructions carefully when taking antibiotics. In particular, be sure you take the full course of antibiotics, even if you feel better. This ensures you completely eradicate the low levels of bacteria that will remain once you are feeling better; this bacteria can become resistant to antibiotics and become extremely difficult to treat later on. If you've had laryngitis for more than a few weeks and are a smoker, your doctor will likely refer you to an ENT (ear, nose, and throat doctor), who may use a laryngoscopy \u2014 a small tube with a tiny camera to get a better look at the back of your throat . If you have severe laryngitis that's not caused by bacteria and not helped by home remedies, then ask your doctor about the pros and cons of a short course of corticosteroids, such as prednisone, prednisolone or dexamethasone. Steroid medications are powerful and fast-acting anti-inflammatories that can reduce the swelling, pain and other symptoms in your throat. However, due to significant downsides, they are usually not recommended except as emergency treatments for people who must use their voices professionally.  The downside of steroidal medications is that they tend to reduce immune system function, weaken tissues and cause water retention, which is why they are typically prescribed for short periods of time only. Corticosteroid medication comes in pills, injectables, inhalers and oral sprays, which are especially effective for quickly combating a bout of laryngitis. As noted above, laryngitis is caused by a variety of diseases that affect the throat. For example, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) often triggers laryngitis because the stomach acid that flows up the esophagus irritates and inflames the throat and larynx. Thus, treating GERD with antacid and proton-pump medications will eventually clear up the laryngitis also. Similar approaches should be used for other conditions that trigger laryngitis, such as an enlarged thyroid gland, allergies, chronic sinusitis, bronchitis, benign vocal cord growths and throat cancer.  Chronic laryngitis (hoarseness) from long-term smoking can clear up on its own after quitting, although it may take many months or even a few years for the vocal cords to become healthy again.

When your body is dehydrated, it often shows first in your lips. The more water, the better! Drink consistently throughout the day, not all at one time. That's not going to help your lips immediately! When your lips are chapped, avoid the temptation to lick them constantly or pick at them. These two common habits just make the situation worse. Licking your lips may bring temporary relief, but as the saliva on your lips evaporates, it dries out your lips. Picking at the skin on your lips may lead to bleeding, an infection, or a cold sore.  If you feel the urge to lick or pick at your lips, immediately apply a lip balm instead. Reapply lip balm or ointment after drinking or rinsing out your mouth. Be careful which over-the-counter ointment or lip balm (e.g. Chapstick) you use to heal your cracked lips. Many contain ingredients (e.g., camphor or menthol) that make lips feel better temporarily, but which may actually dry out your lips even more, forcing you to reapply them again and again.  Look for a lip balm that contains beeswax, shea butter, coconut butter, almond oil, or other natural moisturizers - and not much else. Don't choose a lip balm with an extra-long list of ingredients you can't pronounce. A vitamin E or glycerin-based ointment containing other natural ingredients could also be helpful.  Avoid using lipstick to moisturize your lips. Lipstick can be drying - you need a protective ointment underneath. In some cases, you can develop an allergy to lipstick or red dye #40, which is included in many lipstick formulas. If this happens, the lipstick can make your lips very irritated or even cause a rash. For an ultra-moisturizing lip treatment, rub a little oil on your lips. It will soothe and moisturize your lips while also protecting them from further damage. Use natural moisturizers made from nut oils and seed butters. Here are some examples:  Coconut oil Almond oil Jojoba oil Olive oil Cocoa or shea butter Rosehip oil If your lips are so cracked that it hurts to smile, try soothing them with a home remedy that will make them feel better. Here are a few suggestions:  Rubbing a cucumber slice on your lips daily for about 10 minutes is also known to be effective. Rubbing some aloe vera gel on your lips can be soothing. Rubbing a little honey on your lips will moisturize them and make them feel better. Slather on an unflavored lip balm that contains natural oils or butters, such as coconut oil or shea butter. These include cosmetics and heavily flavored lip balms. They can dry out your skin. Be sure to always read the label, looking for fragrances or perfumes listed in the ingredients.

Discharge caused by a yeast infection is a thick, chunky, white or light yellow. The pH of the vagina becomes more alkaline with BV. Yeast infections do not impact vaginal pH.

What in particular set your cat off? If it was a one-time occurrence, such as workers in the house, you can anticipate for next time and put your cat in a quiet room until they leave. If it was a stray cat outside, you can use techniques to rid yourself of stray cats, such as water sprinklers or chemical sprays that deter cats from your yard. If it is a problem that is likely to recur (such as trips in the car, company, thunderstorms) you can take some steps to help your cat better cope with the situation. Pheromones are chemicals released from glands on the cat's body\u2014face, feet, back and tail\u2014that cats release to communicate with other cats. Certain pheromones, such as those released from the cats face when they rub on objects or their humans, have a calming effect on stressed cats. Scientists have managed to synthesize these chemicals which come in various forms such as collars, sprays, wipes, and plug-in diffusers. There are a few other non-medicated options available to calm an anxious or stressed cat. Essential oils or herbal blends can mimic pheromones and can be tried in place of the synthetic pheromones. Food supplements have also proved helpful to relieve anxiety and stress in cats. The ingredients in these supplements help to support the cat\u2019s natural chemical balance to aid in relaxation.  They come in liquid, chew and tablet forms.  Body wraps (thunder shirts or anxiety wraps) are another non-medication calming aids. These cloth and Velcro wraps wrap around the cat\u2019s body and exert gentle pressure on pressure points which aid in calming cats. The principle is similar to swaddling an infant or wrapping the cat into a towel. Not every cat will respond positively to having to wear a wrap or to the pheromones or blends. You may have a period of trial and error to see what response your kitty has to these products. Some cats have a certain chemical makeup that necessitates the use of medications to help them cope with anxiety or stress producing situations. There are short-term options to use for the occasional trip in the car or visits from certain people your cat has taken a disliking too. Various medications are available to sedate a cat for a short term, temporary situation. These medications require an examination and a prescription from a veterinarian make certain the cat is healthy enough to take them.  Not all cats react the same to the same medication, so most veterinarians will suggest an initial trial with a medication while at home to gauge your cat\u2019s reaction to the sedative. Keep in mind, some sedatives need to be given an hour or so prior to travel or anticipated stressful event so the cat doesn\u2019t override the medication effects due to a buildup of anticipation anxiety. There are a broad range of sedatives used in cats. They all have side effects and precautions for use especially in cats with health conditions like kidney failure, heart disease, and diabetes. Only your veterinarian can advise you on the right one for your cat. Sedatives used in cats include:  Benzodiazepines. Examples are alprazolam, midazolam, and lorazepam. These are the most widely used sedatives in cats. They work almost immediately to reduce fear and anxiety in cats working on the same part of the brain as alcohol does in humans. Note: NEVER give alcohol to a cat. SARI\u2019s. Trazodone is an example of this type of sedative. It works quickly to relieve anxiety. Clonidine and gabapentin. These have sedative and antianxiety effects in animals including cats. Chlorpheniramine and Benadryl are allergy and cold medications which have been used for cat sedation. Phenobarbital is another sedative used in cats. There are long-term solutions for those few cats that are suffering from constant anxiety. In cats with severe, crippling anxiety long-term medication (given daily for months to years) is the best solution to make life more pleasant for them and their humans. Luckily, there are now fairly safe medications which can temper down the chemical imbalances which make life miserable.  These medications include: Amitriptyline (an antidepressant that helps animals with anxiety), Buspirone Hydrochloride (helpful with phobias, such as a fear of people in uniform or a fear of thunderstorms), Clomipramine (Clomicalm), and Fluoxetine (Reconcile, Prozac). In order for these drugs to work effectively, they need to \u201cbuild up\u201d in the cat's body, so it may take up to 6 weeks to find out if they work on the cat.

These can all be measured via the same blood test. They include: the creatinine, the eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate), the BUN (blood urea nitrogen), and the creatinine clearance.  The results you receive on these blood tests will be very effective at testing your kidney function. They will indicate to your physician whether there are any signs of kidney disease - either acute (short-term) problems, or signs of chronic and ongoing kidney troubles. Creatinine is a waste product that accumulates in the blood. With normal healthy kidneys, the creatinine waste product is effectively removed from the blood via the kidneys which filter it out through the urine. When you have kidney disease, however, the rate at which creatinine is filtered and removed from your blood slows, leading to a build-up of this waste product that can subsequently be detected on blood tests.  The purpose of measuring creatinine is that it provides insight into your kidney function, and also allows your doctor to calculate the eGRF (the estimated glomerular filtration rate). The eGFR is not a quantity that is directly \"measured\" via the blood test; rather, it is calculated (approximately) based on your creatinine reading. The calculated value for eGRF that your doctor comes up with based on your creatinine results is another important way to evaluate kidney function, because it gives insight as to the rate at which the glomeruli in your kidneys are filtering blood. A creatinine level between 0.5-1.5mg/dL is considered normal in men, and 0.6-1.2mg/dL is considered normal in women.  An eGFR above 60mLs/min/1.73 square meters is considered indicative of normal and healthy kidney function (as long as you do not have other signs or symptoms of kidney disease). An eGFR below that is diagnostic of kidney disease. BUN is another waste product that can build up in the blood when the kidneys are not functioning adequately, and is hence used as a potential sign of kidney disease or acute kidney impairment. The downside to BUN is that this waste product may also be elevated in other disease states, such as for patients with congestive heart failure, or in the midst of a heart attack or in shock. The benefit to BUN, however, as opposed to simply using the creatinine waste product measurement, is that an elevated BUN is less likely to have false positive results than an elevated creatinine.  The creatinine clearance rate is when the creatinine measurement in your blood is compared to the creatinine measurement in your 24-hour urine test. Your physician can then determine the rate at which creatinine is being filtered from your blood through your kidneys into your urine.", "gt_summary": "See your physician for a blood test to evaluate your kidney function.

Consistently puffed up feathers, combined with lethargy, is usually the first sign of illness in a lovebird. If you notice these symptoms, take your bird to the vet immediately. Problems with the beak can indicate any number of problems, including the critical Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease (PBFD). Check to see if the beak is overgrown, flaky, discolored, loses symmetry, or if there is discharge around the nares (the nostril-like openings on the beak). If you suspect your bird may have PBFD, isolate them from any other birds immediately and make an appointment with your vet, as this disease is highly contagious. Sick birds and new birds should always be quarantined away from other birds. Abnormal droppings could be signs of a serious illness, including PBFD and Chlamydiosis.

Stand facing away from the wall, and slowly back up until you are standing in solid contact with it (but not leaning against it). Your feet should be shoulder-width apart, flat on the floor beneath you, and a few inches off the wall. Ideally, you want three contact points between your body and the wall:  the back of your head, your shoulder blades, and your buttocks.  If you have poor standing posture, you may find that your mid-back (perhaps along with your buttocks) touches the wall first. Although less common, some people lean back too far instead of slouching forward, in which case your head alone may touch the wall first. If you are not making contact with your head, shoulder blades, and buttocks, reorient your upper body without moving your feet so that you are in a proper standing position. Once you get a feel for standing up straight against the wall, try walking away while maintaining your proper upper-body posture.

Depending on what you're going for, and the resources available to you, it's good to pick some combination of strength training and isometric exercises, which only use your body weight as resistance. Consider joining a local gym, which may have several machines dedicated to exercising your legs. Doing squats is the best way to tighten not only your thighs, but your legs, buns, and abs. Do squats in different positions for different results. To do a squat, place your feet shoulder-width apart, and flex your legs until your thighs are at a 90\u00b0 angle with the floor. Keep your back straight and your butt back. Then, stand back up to straight. Repeat this 20-50 times, doing sets of 10-15.  The sumo squat is a great way to tone your inner and outer thighs. To do this, take the widest stance possible, then squat as low as you can. Do this 20-50 or more times a day to see fast results. Another great one is the plie squat. This is great for toning. To do this, put your arms above your head like a ballerina about to do a plie, while keeping your legs together. Then extend one leg from your right or left side, step into a wider stance and squat. Do 20-50 repetitions per day. Lunges are a wonderful way to tone the lower body. To do lunges, stand with your hands on your hips and your feet together.  Extend one leg and step forward and squat with your left leg still behind you.  Repeat this as many times as you can on each leg.  Lunges will target and tone your thigh areas if done correctly. The great thing about lunges is that if you do do them consistently and correctly, you will see amazing results, as it takes more effort than doing squats.  If you have any sort of knee issues, lunges can be difficult. Squats are a bit easier on the knees. Butterflies are done on the ground with your legs in an almost seated position. Your knees should be parallel to your groin. From there, move your leg up and down locked in that position like a butterfly flaps its wings. Do this about 50 times on each side. You can't spot-reduce fat. Any activity or diet which burns fat from your body will burn that fat proportionately over your body, not specifically near the area or muscle group which has been worked. For instance, doing squats will not reduce the fat on your buttocks and legs before anything else. Squats will help reduce the fat on your whole body, however.

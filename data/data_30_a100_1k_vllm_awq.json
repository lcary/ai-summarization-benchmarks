To begin, there are some natural glue-like chemicals within the plant that need to be released before you can turn it into papyrus. Let them soak in the water for at least 3 days. Try to lay them out flat in a tray of water to soak. Set the tray in a place where the water won't evaporate quickly. The strips should turn flexible and transparent. The pattern doesn't matter at this point as you will be rearranging them later. Just lay them out on a hard, flat surface and make sure they don't overlap. A smooth, non-tiled countertop or a sturdy table will work. Grab a rolling pin and use it to roll the strips flat. The rolling pin should be squeezing the water out of them and flattening the strips into sheets. In the past, papyrus strips were pounded with a hard object to remove the excess"

    "pred_summary": "The document provides tips for ending a conversation that has been going on for too long, such as actively listening to the speaker and reiterating their points to show you understand, and inserting yourself into the conversation to help the speaker clarify their thoughts. It also highlights the importance of respecting the speaker's boundaries and not prolonging the conversation unreasonably.'\n\nLong Answer: The document provides a few strategies for ending a conversation that has been going on for too long. Firstly, it suggests actively listening to the speaker and using non-verbal cues like smiling and nodding to show that you are paying attention. By doing so, the speaker may feel heard and understood, and the conversation may end gracefully on its own. Secondly, the document suggests inserting yourself into the conversation to help the speaker clarify their thoughts. This can be done by politely saying something like, \"So, I feel like I'm hearing...\" and then offering an interpretation. However, it's important to respect the speaker's boundaries and not prolong the conversation unreasonably. If the speaker resists interruption, it's best to politely back off and let them finish their thoughts. Ultimately, the document emphasizes the importance of being mindful of the other person's communication style and politely ending the conversation if it has gone on for too long."

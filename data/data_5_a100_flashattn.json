Often, this is done through connecting with your body because your body uses sensations to connect to the present moment. Have a daily meditation practice or make your daily activities a meditation by practicing mindfulness through observing your breath, especially when you're experiencing intense emotions. Tune into your everyday sensations such as feeling the water hitting your skin as you shower, observing the way your muscles and bones shift as you walk or climb stairs, or tuning into what noises you hear around you. Allow thoughts and feelings to pass through your mind without judging them or reacting to them. This can help you stay detached from negative experiences.  Practicing mindfulness can help increase positive emotions, increase gray matter in the brain, and boost compassion toward others and yourself.  Drop in on a meditation class or find a phone application to help you practice mindfulness meditation. Imagine your life in the future when you are at your best. Consider all aspects of your life: health, hobbies/activities, career, friends, and family. Don't get caught up in how your life does not reflect these now and focus solely on the future. Get creative and continue writing for 15 minutes, diving into the depths of what you will be doing, what things you will enjoy, and who you will spend time with. People who do this exercise report feeling more positive even one month after completing it.  Imagining your best possible self can help you figure out your goals, dreams, and desires. It can help you identify your dreams and create steps to get you there. Think about what your best possible self looks like. What job do you have? Where do you live? Do you have pets? What kinds of things do you do for fun? Who are your friends and what do you like about them? If you need a boost at home, in the car, or at work,  keep some positive affirmations around to maintain an optimistic approach. You can also practice saying positive affirmations before your workday, events, or other situations where you may need a boost of positivity. Get in the habit of saying a meaningful affirmation when you wake up, when you're on your way to work, or before you attempt something challenging. This can help train you to approach situations more positively. The benefits of affirmations can last months and years. For example, when you wake up, say to yourself, \u201cI am capable and able to approach the day with kindness and love,\u201d \u201cI can be successful at work today and every day,\u201d or \"I can be happy about some things today.\" Keeping your body healthy can keep your brain healthy. Getting good rest can help your brain perform more optimally and boost your happiness. Not getting enough sleep affects your mind and can impact your stress levels. Low sleep can affect your physical and mental functioning, so make sure you're getting restful sleep each night. If you have problems sleeping, try waking up and going to bed at the same time each day, even on the weekends. Create a relaxing sleep environment and do calming activities before bed such as reading, taking a bath, or sipping tea. Keep your bedroom relaxing. If excessive light disturbs you, buy darker curtains. Make your bedroom a place that looks and feels relaxing to you by decorating it in soft, not bright, tones. Eating wholesome, nourishing meals can help you stay energized and feeling good throughout the day instead of in a \u201cbrain fog.\u201d Make sure to include whole grains, proteins, and fats in your diet.  If you don't know how to balance your meals or get proper nutrients, work with a nutritionist or use a food diary to keep track of your nutrients.

Sewing a simple pinafore dress with a blue and white gingham fabric will serve as a great costume. Dorothy's blouse was a high-necked, buttonless blouse with puffed sleeves. If you can't find an exact match, try any short sleeved blouse. Many major retailers sell flats or heels covered in red glitter. Dorothy's ruby slippers had bows on top, so if you want to be authentic, try to find a red sequined bow to add to the top.  You can make your own red glitter shoes. Take a pair of shoes with a wide heel around 2 inches tall. Clean the shoes, and then in small sections begin to cover the shoes with fabric glue. Apply a liberal amount of red glitter to the section covered in glue. Wait for the glue to fully dry before applying glitter to other sections or filling in holes.

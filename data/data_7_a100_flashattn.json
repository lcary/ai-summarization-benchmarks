[{"doc": "There are 3 types of bonds that you can buy from issuers. These are fixed rate bonds, floating bonds, or payable at maturity bonds. Each one has a different payment schedule and interest rate.  Fixed rate bonds will earn money based on an interest rate set when you bought the bond. You will receive payments once or twice a year from the interest that the issuer owes you. You will receive the face value (or original value of the bond) back when the bond matures. Floating bonds will also pay out once or twice a year, but the issuer can change the interest rate based on the current market. This could benefit you if the interest rates  go up but not if rates fall. You will receive the face value back when the bond matures. Bonds that are payable at maturity will not pay anything until the bond matures. Once it does, you will receive the face value and any accumulated interest. These bonds are often cheaper to buy, but it takes longer to get your investment back. Higher ratings mean that the bond is lower risk. Triple A (AAA) rating is the highest. Bonds with a rating of BB or below are very risky. When you buy the bond, you should be told what the bond rating is. There are 3 agencies that rate bonds. These are Moody\u2019s Investors Service, Standard & Poor\u2019s Corporation, and Fitch Ratings. You can visit their websites and look up the company to find the rating. Treasury bonds are fixed rate bonds that pay out every 6 months. They mature in 30 years. To buy treasury bonds, go to https://treasurydirect.gov/. Create an account. Once a month (usually around the 15th), the government releases more bonds. You can then buy the bonds through the website. The schedule of bond releases can be found here: https://www.treasurydirect.gov/instit/annceresult/annceresult.htm. You cannot buy bonds from companies or towns directly. You must have a broker. You can find a broker online or at a local bank, brokerage firm, or investment firm.  Brokers will charge a percentage of the cost of the bond as a fee. Some brokers may require you to spend a certain amount of money on bonds to hire them. If you want to invest in bonds, it is a good idea to buy different types of bonds. Get many bonds with different interest rates, maturation dates, and face values. You may even get bonds with different levels of risk. The safer bonds will protect you against the riskier investments. It is a good idea not to have all of your bonds mature at the same time. For example, you might have a 2-year bond, a 10-year bond, and a 20-year bond.", "gt_summary": "Pick what type of bond you want to buy. Check the bond rating to see how risky the bond is.

You don't want your millionaire to want you only because you fulfill a specific picture, because that makes you very easy to replace. It doesn't set you apart. It's easy to find plenty of girls who fit that image. It's hard to find one that excites him and can match him in the things he enjoys or wants for his life. Another part of the clich\u00e9, of course, is that you only love him for his money. It's fine to want a guy that can provide for you, but you should choose a guy that can provide for you and that you also love and have a deep connect with. He doesn't want an obvious gold digger, because he knows that will just cause his peers to judge and pity him. He wants to feel loved. Most men, rich guys included, want a woman who respects herself. Why should he like you if you don't act like you think you're likable? Show him you're worth it by taking care of your body and appearance (eat healthy, exercise, dress for success, and practice good hygiene). Usually, rich men don't want a total bimbo. They're usually pretty smart themselves, and they want someone that can keep up with them. It's more interesting for them! Study hard in school and stay interested in learning once you're out of school. Go to college if you can, and if you can't, attend free online courses from services like Coursera and keep up on the latest TEDTalks. Rich guys usually partake in at least some cultural events and you need to be able to enjoy and fit in with that environment. Have a developed interest in music, art, literature, and film. Understand and explore foreign cultures, history, and politics too (since rich guys are often world travelers). No one wants to be with someone who's completely shallow, just an empty shell that never does anything. That's boring! Get out there and do things with your life. Have hobbies and dreams for the future (that you actively pursue, don't just sit around thinking about how much you'd like to be the next big star). This will add complexity to your character and make you seem like a fuller person. Talent is always sexy and makes you more interesting. Learn a skill or build one that you already have. The easiest route to go is to become a great cook (very much a learned skill), but you could also learn to draw or paint or play an instrument. Be a passionate lover but also be passionate in how you live your life. When we're with someone that's really enjoying their life and pursues what they love, that inspires us to do the same.

Also, remember to be extra gentle when maneuvering your dog via their harness. Just like a human recovering from surgery, your dog should take it easy in the days following their procedure. Rest is the most important thing so that their body can heal. Encourage your dog to relax by laying down on the floor beside them. Build up to taking slow walks around the neighborhood.

However, identifying the scorpion species allows you to determine whether treatment is necessary, and in the case of venomous species, will allow medical professionals to give you the correct treatment. If you have a glass jar much larger than the scorpion (a quart or liter size is usually suitable), attempting to capture it will give an expert the greatest chance of identification. However, if you cannot see the scorpion, or do not have an appropriate container, do not attempt this step.  Find a large glass jar, easily large enough to cover the scorpion and tall enough that your hands will be well out of reach of the stinger when you hold it upside-down. If you have them, find a pair of tongs that are at least 10 inches (25 cm) long. Capture the scorpion with the jar or tongs. Hold the jar upside-down and place fully over the scorpion. If you have tongs long enough to use them while staying out of reach, use them to firmly grasp the scorpion and place it into the jar instead. Fasten the lid. If the jar is upside-down, slide a large piece of heavy construction paper or cardboard under the opening, then hold it from the outside as you flip the container upside-down. Attach a tight lid or place a large, heavy book over the opening. If you do not have the correct tools for capturing the scorpion, photograph it instead. Take several photographs from different angles if possible. Having images to refer to will help you find details you may not remember, and if you need to seek expert attention, will help a medical professional identify the species for you. Scorpions with thick, fat stingers and tails are often more dangerous than scorpions with thin stingers. While it is still useful to capture or photograph the scorpion for specific species identification, you should seek medical attention even if you have not yet experienced serious symptoms, especially if you are in Africa, India, or the Americas. If you only got a good view of the pincers, you can estimate your risk from them as well: large, powerful pincers often indicate the scorpion relies on them for defense more than venom. This is not a foolproof system, but may be valuable information to pass on to a medical professional. If you are in the southwestern United States or northern Mexico, look for images of the \"Arizona bark scorpion\" online and compare them to the scorpion that caused the injury. Note that bark scorpions at high elevations tend to be striped, while desert dwelling bark scorpions are usually a uniform tan or light brown. The stings of these scorpions can be fatal and require immediate medical attention. If you are elsewhere in the United States, there is low risk of serious injury from scorpion stings. You should still treat the injury site as described below, and be prepared to see a doctor if you experience allergic reactions or other serious symptoms. The \"deathstalker scorpion\", also known as the Israeli desert scorpion, grows to a maximum of 4.5 inches (11.5 cm) and can vary widely in color and pincer size. Because of the risk of heart or lung failure associated with their stings, any sting from a scorpion smaller than an adult's hand encountered in this region should be treated by medical professionals as soon as possible.  As noted earlier, fat-tailed scorpions can be extremely dangerous as well, and many species are found in this region. Unidentified, thin-tailed species are typically low risk, but due to the large number of scorpion species in Africa, not all of which have been thoroughly studied, be prepared to seek medical attention if any symptoms besides pain and slight swelling develop. Most scorpions in this area are not dangerous to adults, but there are exceptions. One of the more dangerous is the \"Brazilian yellow scorpion;\" as with many dangerous scorpions, it tends to have a thick, fat tail. The are few remaining scorpion species that can cause fatality or serious injury in adult humans, but as not all species have been identified, it is always a good idea to seek medical attention if the victim experiences any symptoms besides pain and mild swelling around the injury site.  Stings from small, red or orange scorpions in India, Nepal, or Pakistan should be treated with medical attention immediately. These may be Indian red scorpions. There is low risk of death or serious injury for an adult due to scorpion venom from Europe, Australia, or New Zealand.

One way to do this is to consider the credibility of the source that you are getting information from. Whether you\u2019re reading a news headline or talking to a notorious gossip, ask yourself whether this source is peer-reviewed or well respected, or whether this person has misled you before. You can\u2019t believe everything you hear or everything you read on the Internet, or you\u2019ll become one of those people who believes a headline from The Onion.  If you\u2019re reading a piece of news online, check out where it\u2019s coming from. Read about the journal or magazine and see how long it\u2019s been around, who contributes to it, and whether it\u2019s a scholarly or well-respected source. See if the source is an authority on the subject. If your cousin is trying to tell you all about which car to get but he doesn\u2019t even have a driver\u2019s license, then consider the possibility that he may not know what he\u2019s talking about. Before you believe something or make a decision, make sure you have done ample searching for evidence to back it up. Don\u2019t just believe something because your friend told you it\u2019s true, but spend time researching the situation on reliable sources on the Internet, checking it out at your local library, or talking to experts in the field to find out whether it\u2019s true. People who are gullible are often also lazy, because they feel that it\u2019s less work to simply believe what they are told instead of making an effort to investigate the matter on their own.  If you\u2019re looking for the truth about a scholarly matter, then make sure you\u2019re reading a peer-reviewed journal, so you know that the source has been approved as credible. You don\u2019t want to get scholarly information on someone\u2019s personal blog, unless that person is a respected scholar. The library is under appreciated as a source of information today. If you want to use it but feel shy about it, just talk to the librarian about how you can search for information. Another way to be less gullible is to come to terms with the fact that you, along with every other person on this planet, have a lot more to learn. If you act like you know everything and simply accept everything that you are told or that you read, then you\u2019ll be continuing to live a life without challenging your own beliefs. Instead, admitting that you don\u2019t know a lot about politics, for example, can help you see that your cousin\u2019s oversimplified argument about Obama may not be as convincing as it sounds, at first.  It\u2019s humbling to admit you don\u2019t know everything there is to know. This is the first step to becoming a more critical thinker and to understanding that arguments are often more complicated than they seem, or more complicated than you may give them credit for. While you should admit you don\u2019t know everything to yourself, you don\u2019t have to be eager to offer this information to others. For example, if you\u2019re buying a car, you don\u2019t want to tell the salesperson, \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about cars\u2026\u201d or you\u2019re making it much more likely that people will take advantage of you. People who seek information are always reading and learning more. They don\u2019t just get their news from one source, and they don\u2019t just read books by the same three authors, either. They are always on the hunt for new knowledge, whether they are reading the latest Jonathan Franzen novel or Scientific American. They are never satisfied, because they know there\u2019s more out there than meets the eye, and they are always determined to find it.  Carve out a chunk of time every day, or at least every week, to do some reading. You can be systematic about it and get determined to understand everything there is to know about geology or contemporary poetry, or you can just read whatever piques your interest that week. The most important thing is that you develop a thirst for knowledge and continue to question the world around you. If people know you are knowledgeable and well-read, they will be less likely to try to trick you or to get you to fall into a trap. If you want to be less gullible, then one thing you can do is ask as many questions as you need to fully understand a situation. Whether you\u2019re considering buying a new car or a home, or your older sibling is telling you the best way to bleach your hair, it\u2019s important to gather as much information as you can before making a decision or agreeing to see something a certain way. Many people are afraid to ask questions because they don\u2019t want to admit that they don\u2019t know something, but this is the best way to keep yourself from being gullible and buying in to something too easily.  Plus, if you\u2019re the kind of person who is known for asking questions, then people will be less likely to try to trick or scam you. If you\u2019re in class, then asking a million questions may derail the teacher a bit. Just ask what you really need to know right then and talk to the teacher after class if you have further questions. If you really want to think critically and investigate situations thoroughly, then you should avoid getting all of your information or opinions from one source. Sure, your friend or cousin might have almost sold you on the best way to bake apple pie or mow your lawn, but you\u2019re better off asking another person what they think or looking up the issue or story online. If you\u2019ve only heard a \u201cfact\u201d from one person, then you\u2019re much more likely to get tricked than if you ask more people what they think.  The same goes for reading your news. Try not to get all of your news from one source or your thinking is likely to be biased. Read at least 2-3 news sources so you don\u2019t fall for any tricks or believe something that isn\u2019t entirely true. The internet can be a great resource for asking questions.

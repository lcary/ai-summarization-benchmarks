When you've settled down and made your love nest together, here are some ways to keep the woman in your life melting:   Make her breakfast in bed on the weekend. You can also cook breakfast or dinner for the whole family. If you're not already cooking for the family regularly, start making this a regular routine. Also. know what her favorite foods are. When you go grocery shopping together, add them to the cart as an automatic reflex. You'll send shivers of delight down her spine! Do things without having to be asked. Take care of the vacuuming, the pets or the pile of dishes in the sink. Repair broken items around the house. Take care of the kids for a day. Take them out and wear them out so they come home exhausted and don't want to hassle her! Or give her the special delight of arranging an entire day of playing with them and feeding them at home, allowing her to just sit back and enjoy the sound of her children laughing and enjoying themselves all day. This combination that will definitely make her heart melt: you caring for the kids while they are laughing with joy. Take care of her when she's sick. Make special meals, fetch her mail, fluff up her pillows, rub her back, get the temperature \"just right,\" rent her favorite movies, and if you have kids, tell her not to worry because you're taking care of everything. When she's tired, run her a warm bath with something scented in the water, or give her a relaxing massage. Carry her to bed if she falls asleep anywhere else. Gifts that are unique and thoughtful in nature are a lovely way to tell her that she's special.  Give traditional gifts in the beginning of the relationship, such as stuffed animals, your sweater or sweatshirt or a piece of jewelry. After you've been together for a while, start coming up with something a little more personalized so that she'll know you're into her. Have the gift customized. For example, you can inscribe a special message on a mug, T-shirt or bracelet. Then, give her a note card that says, \"I want you to know that I appreciate everything you do. I probably should tell you more. I think you're the complete package. So I'm giving you this bracelet to show how much I appreciate you,\" she'll melt. Don't just buy the first bundle of flowers that the florist has to offer. Go out of your way to either select flowers that you know she loves or to find less common ones, such as violets or freesias. You can also pick wildflowers and give them to her yourself--she'll definitely melt. Choose handmade chocolates from a hard-to-find artisan chocolate shop. Or if you're good at it, go all out and make them yourself!  Remember your anniversaries and arrange unique ways to celebrate them. And tickle her pink by mentioning an upcoming anniversary before  she does! Saying things that make her melt depends on who she is and how well you know her. While you won't find a 1-size-fits-all formula, have a toolbox full of general sweet somethings that you can use until you know her a little better. Here are some of you might like to try:  Acknowledge her sense of humor. Tell her that she makes you laugh. Ask her, \"How was your day?\" It's surprising how many times people forget this simple nicety. Yet, it means a lot because it gives her an open invitation to talk about herself. Ask specific questions about her job or about her day raising your children. If you've been apart a few days, tell her you miss her. Something like: \"Can't wait to see you; feels like it's been an eternity since we've been together.\" If things have been flagging a little lately in the romance department, tell her: \"Honey, I want to increase the romance in our lives.\" Tell her there's no one else like her. She's unique, and nobody else in the world is as right for you as she is. Everyone likes being told how special they are. Doing this serves as an especially powerful tonic if she's feeling insecure. When you're getting ready to propose, tell her: \"I cannot wait to spend every moment of my entire life with you.\" Your own special words for one another are a reminder of the unique love for one another and it's important to continue using these even as your relationship turns into everyday living.  Call her by a pet name. Some of the cute names women like may include kitten, love, sweetheart, sweetie, babe, gorgeous, darling/darlin', princess or a sweet nickname that you came up with on your own. Tell her that you love her regularly. Few of us tell one another often enough that we love each other. For example, in public, say \"Sweetie, I love you\" loudly enough for people around you to hear, and then kiss her. Or call her or text her for no other reason than to say, \"I love you.\" Book everything, create a small portfolio of the trip and ask her to \"close your eyes\" and then \"open your eyes and look where I'm taking you\" before placing the itinerary in her hands.

If there's nowhere to pull over safely, skip this step.  You can look for change once you're stopped at the toll booth, or you can just move on with the procedure. Check your pockets, dashboard, and center console to make sure you don't have any change handy for the toll.  If you scrape together enough change, you won't have to go through the longer process of mailing in your payment later. Many toll booth zones have several booths, only one or a few of which are inhabited by a live representative.  Since you need to speak with someone about your situation, scan the available toll booths and select one where you can see an employee inside. Occasionally\u2014often at night or in isolated areas\u2014you will encounter a toll zone with no live officials at all.  In this case, drive through automated toll booth locations and allow the automated system to take a picture of your license plate. The citation/bill will be mailed to you. Rather than obsessing over your lack of money and worrying about what the operator will say, concentrate on steering safely and pulling up to the booth. Studies have shown that there are more accidents on toll roads, so it\u2019s much more important that you pay attention and stay safe in this scenario than worrying about finding change and avoiding embarrassment. Keep an eye out for specific safety bulletins and speed limits posted at the toll zone.  Some places stipulate very low speed limits in these zones, while others are less strict, so you should always approach them on a case-by-case basis. Speak clearly and concisely so that neither the toll operator nor fellow drivers feel unduly delayed by your problem. Being a toll booth operator can be a difficult and monotonous job, so be sure to address the toll booth operator with a polite and apologetic tone. Once you\u2019re dealing with the official toll booth operator, you are in their hands and have no choice but to wait patiently until the process is completed.  Impatient drivers might honk their horns or shout, but you should stay focused and attentive to the toll official.  This probably won\u2019t take long, but it all depends on the operator and specific circumstances.  The toll booth operator may need to exit the booth in order to record your license plate and ask for your driver's license, but they might instead just make a quick note and wave you through. You might be asked to pull over to a nearby shoulder so that you don\u2019t continue to block traffic.  In this case, the operator will walk over to your car once they have filled out the requisite forms. The operator will let you know what you need to do in order to pay at a later date.  Sometimes the operator gives you Deferred Toll Payment Request Form to take home and fill out. If the attendant doesn't give you a form to take with you, you should keep an eye out for a notice in your mailbox.  A bill for the toll price should arrive within a few weeks, and you should pay as soon as you receive it. Just as you entered the toll booth zone following normal protocol, you should exit the booth as if you had paid the toll.  Observe all posted speed limits and cautions while keeping a careful eye on surrounding drivers. If the attendant gave you a Deferred Toll Payment Request form, you can pay the missed toll as soon as you get home.  You can pay by posting a check or credit card payment to the indicated address, or via an online payment portal.

Your knee should be bent down at a 90 degree angle, making your leg perpendicular to the floor.  You should also relax the muscles in your leg as you prepare to measure it. This leg is the leg you will need to measure. The vast majority of people can get away with only measuring one leg, but if one of your legs is slightly shorter than the others, you may want to consider measuring each leg separately. Your leg is straightest in this position which is why you need to keep it this way for both your calf height and circumference measurements. Place the end of a soft tape measure at the bottom of your heel. Extend the tape measure upwards, over the back of your leg, until it hits a point just below your kneecap. You can then take this calf height measurement and compare it to the shaft height measurement of the boots you are looking at. Find the measured height of the boot on the tape measure as you have it pressed against your calf. This spot is the point at which the boot shaft will most likely land on your leg. Locate the widest part of your calf and place the end of a flexible tape measure there. Wrap the tape measure all the way around your calf until it intersects with this starting point, then take the measurement at this point of intersection.  If you want to be really precise, figure out where the top of the shaft will land on your calf using the shaft height measurement and measure the circumference of your calf at that point. Compare your calf measurement to the shaft circumference of the boot. If the boot shaft circumference is smaller than the circumference of your calf, the boot will not fit well. If it is an exact match, the boot will fit but may feel a little too tight or snug. If the shaft is too much larger\u2014usually 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) or more\u2014the boot may end up feeling too loose. A boot shaft circumference can, however, be 0.5 inches (1.25 cm) smaller than your calf circumference if the material has enough elasticity to stretch over your calf.  An ideal situation would be for your boot shaft circumference to be 0.25 to 1 inch (0.6 to 2.5 cm) wider than your calf circumference. Beyond the basics of fit, your ideal boot shaft height is merely a matter of personal taste and preference. There are a few things worth keeping in mind when considering how high you would like a boot shaft to be, though.  If the shaft of a certain boot will end right at the crease of your knee, that boot is likely to pinch and rub your skin as you sit, making it uncomfortable. If you have notably wide calves, the best options will usually be ankle boots and similarly short boots. The shaft of these boots will stop just above your ankle and below the widest part of your calf, creating a more relaxed fit. Your height can also determine an ideal boot shaft height. As a general rule, shorter legs look better with shorter shafts and longer legs look better with taller shafts. If you are petite, a shaft height taller than 14 inches (35.6 cm) may overwhelm your figure. If you are tall, a shaft height shorter than 15 inches (38.1 cm) may throw off the visual balance of your legs.", "gt_summary": "Sit with your foot flat. Measure up the back of your leg.

Turtles also grow. Therefore, providing lots of space for your turtle to enjoy these activities and giving room to grow is important in making your turtle happy.   Research the potential mature size of your turtle and buy a tank that will reflect his growth. Turtles cannot be crammed into a small space or they will be unhappy. Glass aquariums that provide about three to four times the length of the turtle are most desirable. Turtles need to be able to totally submerge themselves and they need an area to get out of the water and get completely dry. Keep in mind that the bigger the tank is, the happier the turtle will be. Turtles are reptiles that, surprisingly, have a large territory in the wild. Try to reflect that with a large tank. Turtles take pleasure from spending time on land and water, so creating an environment that allows them to do both will make them happy. Although turtle aquariums do not need much landscaping creating an appropriate habitat will maximize your turtle\u2019s health and longevity. Designing the habitat can be a fun and creative project, but always remember to keep your turtle\u2019s needs in mind.   Try to keep the water portion deeper than the shell is wide so your turtle can completely submerge and swim freely. Slope the land portion into the water so your turtle does not have trouble entering or exiting the water portion. Turtles love to bask in the sun. Create a basking platform so your turtle can enjoy the UVA and UVB heat lamps you set up in the tank. Turtles can relax under the light for up to ten to twelve hours a day. Turtles are messy \u2013 they excrete, eat, and leave behind scraps of food in their water. If you do no clean their aquarium, both the turtle and its habitat will stink. Moreover, all this waste could potentially cause high ammonia and nitrate levels.   Clean your turtle\u2019s aquarium weekly or create a separate area outside the tank to feed and allow your turtle to excrete waste before reentering the aquarium. An unclean tank or turtle could result in several different types of diseases that are difficult to treat. Algae will build on your turtle\u2019s shell and will need to be cleaned off with a soft toothbrush. Turtles, like most reptiles, shed. The scutes on your turtle\u2019s shell will become itchy and irritable if you do not keep the shell cleaned off. Always wash your hands before and after handling your turtle so that you do not transfer germs or contaminates to your turtle and to prevent the transfer of salmonella. Turtles, like people, have very different personalities. If you have a social turtle, you might be able to pet or play with them, but a general rule would be to keep handling at a minimum.   In general, turtles do not enjoy being lifted off of the ground, but sometimes it is necessary to remove them from their aquarium for cleaning, playing, or exercise. If so, handle your turtle gently and securely so they do not bite you or try to escape. Remember never to put your turtle on its back, grab its tail, or force it out of its shell. Your turtle will not think that is funny and it will stress them out.

You should also avoid using scented soaps BECAUSE the chemicals in it can cause skin to get dry and irritated. Use mild, unscented soaps instead. Too frequent bathing can cause itching to get worse. Limit baths to once every 2 days. Bathing frequency can vary depending on climate, weather and your activities. However, once in two days should suffice. Avoid using very hot water; it tends to make the skin more irritated. Use water at room temperature or lower.  Hot water dilates  vessels speeding up metabolism of insulin, which can trigger hypoglycemia. Another reason why diabetics should not use hot water is diabetics suffering from nerve damage lose sensitivity to pain and temperature and may unknowingly burn themselves with hot water. Summer is a time of sun and fun, but sun can also seriously irritate skin. To lessen itching in the summer,  wear clothes made from light materials like cotton, chiffon or linen. Certain cloths like wool and silk can cause irritation and itching.:  Make sure to keep the skin dry from sweat as too much humidity can cause itching sometimes. Drink plenty of water to keep skin hydrated. Drink 8 glasses (8-ounce glass) of water per day. However, if you engage in rigorous activity or live in an arid climate you may need to drink more water. Skin easily gets dry in winter, which is why it is very important for diabetics to keep skin well moisturized and hydrated. Moisturize your skin twice a day using unscented lotion.

This means that when you are in stressful situations, your itching increases. To combat feeling stressed, practice relaxation. These include:  Practicing meditation.

Even if you are diligent about recording your dream later in the day, you are less likely to remember the details of the dream, if you remember it at all. Keep your journal and pen on the nightstand ready to go so that it will be the last thing you see before you fall asleep, and the first thing you see when you wake up. You could also keep a dim light on the nightstand, or get a pen with a light built-in so that you can see what you\u2019re writing when you wake up to record a dream in the middle of the night. When you first wake, keep your eyes closed. Think about the last things you remember before you woke up, and try to follow what you remember backwards as far back in the dream as you can. Then, as soon as you\u2019ve gotten as far back as you remember, open your eyes and start writing.  If you do wake up in the middle of the night after a really interesting, good, or crazy dream, write it down right away. You may be certain you\u2019ll remember it in the morning, but you\u2019ll be sorry you didn\u2019t if you wake up in the morning and have forgotten everything. Your memories of your dream can fade quickly, so try not to let anything distract you. Get the main things you remember out quickly, and then try to remember more minute details. Writing dreams in the present tense may be helpful for remembering a few extra details that you had forgotten. If you are writing things in present tense (e.g. \u201cI am feeling\u2026,\u201d \u201cI am walking\u2026,\u201d \u201cI am scared\u2026\u201d), you\u2019re replaying the events of the dream in your head, kind of like a movie. You never know what new memories might pop up. If someone else in the dream is doing something, keep that in present tense as well, but stay in the first person. For example, if your significant other is in the dream, and he is running towards you, write down, \u201c(Name of your significant other) is running towards me. He seems excited about something.\u201d If you end up going back through your dreams to look for patterns, knowing exactly when you had the dream might be helpful. Years down the road, when you think back on what was going on in your life at a certain time, you may notice that your dreams coincided with how you were feeling, even if it wasn\u2019t obvious at the time. You should also give your dream a title. The title should be a short summary of the whole dream. This will also help you find the dream later on. For example, if you had a dream about flying, and you were on a magic carpet, you could title the dream, \u201cFlying Like Aladdin.\u201d You should write down any little detail that you can think of, even if it isn\u2019t a fully-formed thought. Writing it down might help you remember a few more details. If you consistently write it down, you might notice that this small glimpse is something you commonly see. For example, perhaps in your dream you remember seeing a small rainbow beach ball, but cannot remember where you are, where you saw the ball, or where the ball came from. Just make a bullet point in your journal that says, \u201cI am seeing a small rainbow beach ball.\u201d If you want, you can make a note that you don\u2019t remember anything more about the context of the dream. You can even just write the words \u201crainbow beach ball,\u201d if you want.

Abuse can also trigger anxiety or depression. Seeking counseling from a mental health professional can help relieve these symptoms. You can learn to cope effectively with your pain and heal the wounds left by your abuser.  A therapist or counselor who specializes in trauma is a good option. These specialized counselors can help you process the feelings from the trauma you\u2019ve experienced. The International Society for the Study of Trauma and Dissociation has a searchable database of therapists who are members of their organization. The American Psychological Association has a searchable database of psychologists by area.  Many domestic violence programs, shelters, hospitals, and your doctor can also refer you to trained counselors and therapists. Look for a therapist who uses \u201cevidence-based\u201d treatments, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), cognitive processing therapy (CPT), prolonged exposure therapy (PE), or eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR). EMDR is a common treatment used with PTSD.  If children were involved in the domestic abuse, you may find that attending family therapy can help you and your children heal together. You may find a support group or group counseling helpful. Domestic violence programs, shelters, mental health clinics, and religious facilities may offer support groups. You can also find support groups online. If you\u2019re having a hard time finding a group, ask your doctor or therapist. You can also try searching online. Websites such as meetup.com often have listings of support groups in your area. Social support networks are a crucial part of helping survivors recover from abuse. These can come in the form of family and friends, as well as formal networks such as domestic violence services and advocacy.  Talk with friends and family about your experiences. One of the most scarring things about abuse is that victims are often forced to remain silent about their suffering. Sharing your stories with your loved ones and asking for their support can be a huge factor in healing. Make new friends. Abusers often isolate their victims from friends and relatives, leaving survivors feeling alone and helpless. Making new friends can help you recover your sense that you are worthy of love and care.  Joining clubs, exercise classes, or reading groups are good ways to meet new, like-minded people. These can be especially helpful if your abuse isolated you from people.  Get support from domestic violence or child abuse services. Even if the abuse occurred some time ago, you may find it helpful to speak with an advocate who is experienced with domestic abuse cases. These services can often refer you to mental health treatment, financial support, and other resources. Studies suggest that a belief in a deity, fate, or other form of spiritual tradition can help people recover from abuse. This can take the form of organized religion or a more general spiritual belief. This may be because people are able to find comfort and meaning in life through their traditions. Many religious and spiritual traditions also have strong community emphases, which can be a source of support for survivors.  Finding a supportive religious or spiritual community may help alleviate symptoms of anxiety and depression.  Religious communities may also be able to provide financial or other practical assistance.  Many religious communities offer counseling.

Fertilizers are usually labeled with three numbers (N-P-K) representing the amount of Nitrogen, Phosphorus (Potash), and Potassium. Bananas require very high amounts of Potassium, but the other nutrients are important as well. You can use a balanced fertilizer (three numbers roughly equal) or a fertilizer that addresses deficiencies in your soil.  Do not use manure produced in the last few weeks, as the heat it releases while decomposing can damage the plant. Underwatering is a common cause of banana plant death, but overwatering can cause the roots to rot.  In warm growing weather without rain, you may need to water your plant daily, but only if the top 1.5\u20133 cm (0.5\u20131 in.) of soil is dry. Test with your finger before watering.

In cooler temperatures when the banana is barely growing, you may only need to water once every week or two. Remember to check soil moisture. Leaves help evaporate excess moisture, so be careful not to soak (just moisten) a young plant that has not yet grown leaves.  Water the ring of fertilizer as well to help it soak into the soil. Remove dead leaves and banana plants and chop them up to place around the live plants. Other yard waste and wood ash can also be added to return nutrients to the soil. Check the mulch regularly and remove any weeds that are growing. These can compete with the banana plant. If diseased plants are discovered, identify and treat them immediately, or uproot them. Insect pests should also be controlled as soon as they are found. Nitrogen and potassium deficiencies are the two most common nutritional problems for bananas, so learn to recognize the signs.  Signs of nitrogen (N) deficiency: very small or pale green leaves; reddish pink leaf sheathes; poor growth rate; small fruit bunches.  Signs of potassium (K) deficiency: rapid appearance of orange/yellow color on leaves followed by leaf death; small or broken leaves; delayed flowering; small fruit bunches.  Examples of major plant diseases include: Bacterial Wilt/Moko Disease; Panama Disease/Fusarium Wilt; Banana Bunchy Top; Blackhead/Root Rot/Toppling Disease; and Black Leaf Streak.  Examples of major plant pests include: Corn Weevil; Banana Aphid; Mealy Bugs. Fruit pests include: Flower Thrips; Red Rust Thrips; and Scarring Weevil. Once your plant is mature and has several suckers, remove all but one to improve fruit yield and plant health.  Cut all but one sucker off at ground level and cover the exposed plant with soil. Repeat with a deeper cut if they grow back. The surviving sucker is called the follower and will replace the mother plant after it dies. Exceptionally healthy plants can support two followers. There are 3 easy ways of doing it:   Wire/Rope and Bottle Method: Cut off the bottom of a plastic bottle. Insert a very long wire/very strong twine through the mouth and bottom of the bottle. Crunch the bottle to make it bendable and soft. Prop up the banana stem on the bottle, and use the wire to pull the stem slightly more upright. Tie the write to a strong support.  Single Bamboo Method: Use a 3m (10') long bamboo pole or other strong, durable material. Cut a piece of Y-shaped wood 10cm (4\") thick and 60cm (2') wide. Let the stem rest on the middle of the \"Y\" and push the bamboo upwards a little bit so the stem is wedged into the \"Y\" tightly. Bury the other end of the bamboo (the base) deeply into the ground. Tamp very firmly.  Double Bamboo Method: Use two 3m (10') long bamboo poles. On one end of the poles, tie them together with strong wire 30 cm (1') from the end. Open up the poles to form a letter \"X\". Let the stem rest on the short end, push upwards a little bit to create pressure, and bury the other ends of both poles. Tamp very firmly. If temperature during winter months falls too low for your plant, there are several ways to care for it:  Cover the stem with a blanket or soil. If there is no frost and the plant is still small, this may be adequate protection until the temperature rises high enough for it to grow again. Store the plant inside. Uprooting the entire plant, removing the leaves, and store in moist sand in a heated indoor area. Do not water or fertilize; the plant will go dormant until you're ready to plant it outside again. Grow the plant inside. This will require a large pot with drainage hole. If you don't want to grow your banana too big for your pot, you may need to cease or reduce the fertilizer treatments. Salvage pieces to plant later. If frost or cold has killed most of your plant, chances are the suckers and corm at the base are still usable.

That way if any rocking occurs, you will both be safe. You can use an alternative spacer, if necessary. This will prevent the pedal from traveling too close to the floor as you begin to bleed the brakes.

It doesn\u2019t have to be a perfect fit, but it will help keep things cleaner if it is. You only need about 2 to 3 inches (51 to 76\u00a0mm) of brake fluid in the jar.

Other recommended bathroom times for puppies are after playing, right before bedtime, and after spending time in the crate.

The sooner your resume starts beefing up, the better. Even if you're writing the school lunch menu, it counts. Looking for a job in high school? Get a job at a local newspaper, even if it is sorting out their mail. When you come back home for summers, you may be looking at a promotion to something more along the lines of what you're looking for, and it'll be easy to sink into. Plenty of journalists don't have journalism degrees \u2013 if you're naturally a good writer, you've got the hard part covered. But it does make everything a bit easier, so do consider getting an undergrad in journalism...but also something else. Something else a bit more tangible (your parents might call it \u201cpractical\u201d). This way when you write, you have an area of expertise you can actually write about.  Anything is good, but studying technology is probably best.

Computer science and related fields will give you a leg up into digital media.  Landing an awesome journalism gig is hard.

There are likely groups that you don't even realize could give you writing and reporting opportunities. Many groups have newsletters and publicity people whose job is to get the name of the organization out there. That could be you. Truth be told, going to college and majoring in journalism sounds like the platform you need to become a journalist, but often it's not. Having that background doesn't mean your writing is good, it doesn't mean you have interesting things to say, and it doesn't mean you have the connections you need. So take a gap year. Why? You can go abroad, find interesting stories, learn about different cultures and write about it.  This will give you great material should you be looking for freelance gigs. You'll essentially be a location reporter doing international news. What's more, the competition in the West is intense. If you go to a different country with different language and cultural skills, it'll be easier to land a gig to pad that resume. Another plus? It'll help you learn a foreign language.

Because of this, strenuous exercise, or other activities that bring on a good sweat, are good ways to get excess sodium out of your system.  Try a high intensity workout, like circuit training, to help you get in shape and shed extra sodium. Alternatively, you can try more low-impact exercises that can get you sweating, like hot yoga. However, be aware that hot yoga can be dangerous for people with low heat tolerance, so consult your doctor before starting a hot yoga routine. Allowing yourself to get dehydrated while you exercise can actually cause your body to retain salt, potentially leading to a serious health condition called hypernatremia.

When it nudges your hand with its nose, click your clicker and open your hand.  When the dog learns that nudging gets treats, move a few feet away from it and repeat the process. Continue moving further away from the dog until the dog knows to come to you even if you\u2019re all the way across the room. When training the dog, teach it to recognize your symptoms or respond to a command, then reward it with a treat. Carry your treats at all times once the dog is working so that it learns to persist until you are able to give it a treat.  If you\u2019d prefer that the dog pat you, keep your hand open against your leg but with the treat under it. Then wait for your dog to touch your hand with its paw before giving the treat. Not only can your dog fetch your medicine, water, or food, it can also bring you comfort items when you\u2019re coping with flashbacks, fears, episodes, and depressing thoughts.  Start by using an item you would like the dog to fetch, such as a water bottle, as a toy. For example, take an empty water bottle and throw it so your dog can go retrieve it. As the dog gets used to picking up and bringing the item during play, try placing it on a shelf or table. Call the dog to the area where the item is located, then point it out for them.

For example, say, \u201cRover, bring the bottle.\u201d If it does, give it a treat. With each success, reward your dog with treats. While your dog may not need this skill often, it will help your dog retrieve items for you. For example, if your dog needs to bring you water, it will need to open the refrigerator. Additionally, playing tug-of-war can emotionally help both you and the dog.  Begin by playing tug-of-war with your dog using a rope.

To apologize well, you have to be sincere, specific, and recognize the hurt you caused. Accept your role in having damaged trust or respect in the relationship. This doesn\u2019t mean accepting all responsibility, but owning up to your part.  Be sincere and specific. Only apologize to make amends and heal damage and not for some other ulterior reason. At the same time, be specific about what you are apologizing for and how it hurt the other person. For example, \u201cI\u2019m very sorry that I stormed off during our argument. I can see that it hurt you and made you feel humiliated. Please forgive me.\u201d Avoid weasel-worded apologies.

Your first urge may be to correct or refute your partner, but instead let them speak. By showing patience, you also let your partner speak openly without fear or reprisal and demonstrate that you\u2019re serious about healing the rift. Keep in mind that the point of an apology is to heal the relationship. It is not about proving who was right and who was wrong. Make it clear to your partner that you want to save the relationship. At the same time, accept that these things take time. Resist the urge to pursue your partner, especially one who has become distant, or you may end up driving them further away.

If your goal is to text super quick, you may want to take some time to firmly ingrain the keypad in your mind. Take a few days and doodle out the keypad on scrap paper as a way of memorizing your cell phone keypad. Some texting apps allow you to customize your keypad. This can help you organize your keypad so its set up naturally for you. If this option is available to you with your texting app, you may want to customize your keypad. The two main styles of texting for touchscreen phones are generally called \"swiping\" and \"touch type.\" These two techniques are a matter of preference, and you may find that one works best for you over another. You may also find that your phone only supports one and not the other. You'll have to experiment to see which works best for you and check the user manual of your phone to see what style of texting is supported.  Swiping involves touching the first letter of the word you want to type on the touchscreen of your phone and pathing your finger through the rest of the letters of the word without taking your finger off the screen. Once you have finished your word, you should remove your finger from the screen. Touch type is much like the typing you would do on a keyboard. For each letter of the word you are trying to type, you should tap your screen where the letter appears on your on-screen keyboard. Non-touchscreen phones rely on a button based keypad, where each number of your pad generally corresponds to a set of letters of the alphabet. Some phones may also have small keyboards, which you can use as you would a normal computer keyboard, pressing each letter on the keyboard to type words. Phones that use a number pad with corresponding letters often have predictive texting software, like...  T9 predictive text. T9 stands for \"text on 9 keys,\" with the 9 keys being the numerals 1 through 9 on your keyboard. Zero is often used for punctuation. By pressing the numbers that correspond to the letters you need for the word you are trying to text, T9 software should suggest likely options. For example, on many T9 keypads, \"43556\" will suggest the word \"hello.\" Once you have pressed the keys that contain the letters you need to spell your word, you may have many suggested words to choose from. Generally, you'll have to select from among these options by using a directional pad on your phone. Manual texting involves pushing the numbers on your number pad to cycle through the letters associated with that particular number. To manually type the \"h\" in \"hello,\" you'd have first to press the number 4 two times in rapid succession. The first press would suggest \"g\" and the second \"h.\" In this fashion, you'll have to type your words to text. With manual texting, you may have to press a select key, like a button in the center of your directional pad, to select the letter after rapidly pushing the number key. In some cases, your phone will interpret a long pause after pressing the key as the selection of the letter. Some predictive software will offer suggestions for likely words before you finish typing.

When you talk to the girl, try to see if you can find something you share, whether it's a love for a certain sport or sports team, the fact that you grew up in the same place, or even a shared friend or teacher.  Talking about something you share can lead you to open up, see that you can have an exciting conversation, and to talk about new topics.

Let the things you both share come up naturally instead of trying too hard to ask her if she likes the same things you do. Keep things open ended, so the conversation doesn't shut down if it turns out she doesn't share your interests. For example, instead of saying, \"Did you see Frozen?

Don't ask her questions that can only be answered with a \"yes\" or a \"no\" and ask open-ended questions instead, so she has room to talk. Try \"What do you think about\u2026\" instead of \"Do you think that\u2026\" If you're nervous and feel like the conversation is flagging, look around you and see if you can use your environment to your advantage. Maybe there's a flyer for a concert behind you and you can ask the girl if she likes the band. Maybe you're standing near a coffee shop and you can ask her if she ever goes there to read. Maybe you notice she's wearing a sweatshirt for a certain college that your sister went to and you can ask her about her connection to the school. Though you shouldn't start looking around distractedly the second you start the conversation, if you start running out of things to talk about, you can try to pick up some cues from what's around you. This is a creative way to keep the girl's interest and to keep her talking. She'll be impressed by how perceptive you are. If you want to keep the girl's interest, then cracking her up won't hurt. If you make the girl laugh, then she'll want to keep talking to you, so look for opportunities where you can put in a bit of humor. You can lightly poke fun at yourself, make fun of a person you both know in a kind way, or just tell her a corny joke if you really think she'll respond well. If you have a funny story that you think will actually make her laugh, you can tell it, as long as it's not too long and complicated. Don't overdo it, but look for opportunities to make the girl laugh.  If you're not naturally funny, then don't try so hard to be someone you're not. The girl will see that you're really making an effort and might feel bad for you. Instead, just work on being yourself, and if you can make the girl laugh in the process, then great. If you don't know the girl very well, then don't tease her unless you're already flirting and teasing each other. She may take it the wrong way and can get offended, and you definitely don't want that. You may be so nervous about not boring the girl that you could end up dominating the conversation so much that she can't get a word in. Talking the whole time does not mean that you are holding her interest; instead, pausing and leaving room for some silence can be a great opportunity for her to start saying something interesting, too. Don't put all of the pressure on yourself and make sure you are each talking about half of the time, or a little less or more if one of you is shy. If you talk about yourself the whole time, then you'll look self-involved, and she won't want to keep talking to you. Almost every girl loves talking about the things that mean the most to her, so don't forget to ask her about what she likes to do for fun, how often she does it, why she likes it, and why it means so much to her. You don't have to pry too much and you'll see that the girl's face lights up when she starts talking about something that is really important to her. This will make the girl feel special and like you really care about what makes her tick.

Being collaborative means working side by side to reach a resolution, rather than pit your points of view against each other. Seeking a deeper understanding of the other person's point of view will allow you both to move forward towards a resolution. Typically, arguments occur when one person's wants or needs are not being met. So, work together to identify the core issue or problem by expressing how you feel.  When you communicate the issue, be conscious of the language you use. For example, focus on using transitions in your sentence with a phrase like \u201cat the same time\u201d, instead of \u201cbut\u201d. As well, try to express how you feel, as opposed to what you think the other person feels or thinks.  The issue could be identified in a simple statement like: \u201cWhen you use your smartphone at dinner, it bothers me,\u201d or \u201cIt makes me uncomfortable when you talk about my mother like that.\u201d Validating the other person's point of view by acknowledge the error of your actions or words is an important step towards forgiveness and resolution.  This could be as simple as an apology and an acknowledgement that you made a mistake or are cultivating a bad habit like using your smartphone at the dinner table. Of course, this is a two way conversation, so the other person should also be willing to take responsibility for their actions and words, and apologize for responding angrily. Now that you have identified the root cause of the argument, and have both taken responsibility for your actions or words, have a discussion about possible solutions to the issue.  Ask each other questions like: \u201cWhat must change or happen to meet your needs?\u201d \u201cWhat can we both do to not argue about this issue again?\u201d For example, if you struggle with your friend's smartphone at the table during dinner, suggest limiting their smartphone use to before or after dinner. Or if you take offense to the way your partner talks about your mother, discuss the issues your partner has with your mother and how you can both work to minimize these issues together. Finding a \u201cwin-win\u201d solution does not necessarily mean compromising, as sometimes a compromise can act as a quick-fix solution that doesn't last long. A \u201cwin-win\u201d solution is when the needs on both sides of the argument are met. So if you struggle with your friend's smartphone use, agree to times before and after dinner where they are free to use their phones. Or if you have an issue with the way your partner talks about your mother, be open to discussing why your partner talks about your mother in a certain way, and consider a solution where your partner spends less time around your mother. Showing that you forgive the other person through a physical action like shaking hands, hugging, or even make up sex will reinforce your willingness to move past the argument. It will also be a good reminder for any future disagreements, as you have both acknowledged your mutual respect and love for each other.  Now that you've had a healthy discussion about your relationship, it's important to reward yourselves by enjoying each other's company, so go out for dinner, watch a movie together, or have another drink.  In fact, science has shown that the old adage, \u201cdon't go to bed angry\u201d proves true, so don't settle for holding a grudge or withholding your forgiveness, and instead go to bed or leave the discussion with a strong sense of reconciliation and resolution.", "gt_summary": "Listen to each other's points of view.

Some goals may include:  Weight Loss Managing high blood pressure, diabetes or high cholesterol Supporting increased fitness levels Becoming more environmentally conscious Improving your general health or wellness If you've tried other diets or eating patterns, try to remember how they worked for you, what you liked or didn't like about them and whether you felt they were a good fit for your lifestyle.  For example, if you tried following a vegetarian diet, but missed eating meat.  Or if you tried a low carb diet, but it made you feel foggy and tired throughout the day.  If a diet didn't work well in the past, you may want to consider other options. Sticking to a diet plan takes more than willpower.  It truly has to be a plan you can stick with long-term. Each diet or eating plan may come with a cost.  You might need to pay for pre-made foods, protein shakes or vitamin and mineral supplements.  But there are also many diets that require little to no extra costs.  Choose a diet plan that will fit easily within your budget so that you don't have to discontinue your new eating pattern due to high costs. Take advantage of \"sign-up offers\" or promotional rates when you can.  This may help you save a little money on some of the more popular dieting programs. Some diet plans require you to prep all your meals and snacks from scratch, some may be completely web and internet-based and others may require in person group or individual meetings.  Will these types of activities fit with your current lifestyle?  Think about how that may change or need to change for you to be successful on your new dieting plan. If you have to change your lifestyle too drastically, the diet plan may be difficult to stick to long-term.  Some diet plans require time spent cooking while others do the meal prep for you.  If cooking is something you don't typically enjoy doing, think about a diet plan that involves meal replacements like protein shakes, bars or pre-made meals. Make sure to consider your social life as well.  If you love going out to eat or going to the occasional happy hour, you'll want a plan that gives you flexibility to enjoy those activities. Also consider things like food allergies or sensitivities and cultural or religious diet restrictions.  Many diets are very general and may not account for things like these. Physical activity is an important part to any healthy lifestyle.  Plan on including both cardio and strength training exercises each week.  These types of physical activity can help boost your weight loss and help you maintain your goal weight long-term.  In addition, exercise may help improve your mood, improve your sleeping habits, manage high blood pressure or diabetes and improve cardiovascular fitness.

This allows you to take in more oxygen, helping you to hold notes (or screams) for much longer and avoid getting out of breath while performing. When you breathe from your diaphragm your stomach should expand as you inhale and contract when you exhale. Learning how to breathe correctly and naturally from your diaphragm takes practice. Therefore you should start doing daily deep breathing exercises to improve your technique. You will have different levels of tension in your vocal chords depending on how high or low you sing or scream.  For example, when you sing in a low voice your voice box will move down, making your vocal chord tension loose. When you sing in a high voice your voice box moves up, making your vocal chords tight. Good screamo singing is all about control, and in order to have control you need to be aware of how vocal chord tension works and how you can manipulate it. Once you can control vocal tension, you will easily be able to move between high and low registers, even while screaming. A good practice technique is to hum along with the sound of your car engine as you rev it up -- this warms up your vocal chords and allows you to practice moving from high to low registers. Many inexperienced screamo singers damage their voices by trying to scream too loudly -- however, one of the best kept secrets of successful singers is that they actually scream kind of quietly (as weird and contradictory as that sounds).  Don't try to scream at the top of your lungs on your first attempt, start at a low volume and as your voice gets stronger you can gradually increase the volume.  The beauty of screamo is that you can let the microphone do most of the work while you're performing. Even a \"quiet\" scream can rattle your audience's teeth when amplified by a good sound system. You can also produce deeper sounds by cupping your hands around the microphone or by moving your mouth in specific ways as you sing. The best thing you can do is just to play around and experiment with it until you find a sound that you like. One of the best ways to improve your screaming technique is to record yourself singing and then watch it back later (no matter how awkward this might feel).  This can help you to pick up on things like poor posture or pitch-problems which you would never have been aware of otherwise. Recording yourself allows you to really hear what you sound like and become aware of where you need to improve. The first step to improving your singing is to recognize your mistakes. Vocal coaching and screamo singing may not sound like two things that should go together, but screamers can actually benefit hugely from some professional training.  In fact, famous frontmen Randy Blythe, Corey Taylor and Robert Flynn have all improved their screaming technique and learned how to properly care for their voices thanks to professional vocal training. A vocal coach will work with you to train and strengthen your voice. Even a couple of sessions can be worth the money, as your coach will teach you some breathing and warm-up exercises which you can practice at home. Alternatively, you could try to get your hands on a book called \"The Zen of Screaming\" by Melissa Cross, which is pretty much the definitive guide to safe yet awesome-sounding screamo.", "gt_summary": "Breathe from your diaphragm.

Young plants may need more phosphorus to focus on leaf growth, and plants typically need much less of these nutrients outside of the growing season. For best results, look up the specific plants you are growing to find out their needs. This is usually given as three \"NPK\" numbers, telling you the ratio or total amounts of these nutrients in that order. If you want a detailed report on the nutrients already in your soil, send soil samples to your local extension office or soil-testing laboratory. This is not necessary for most home gardens, unless your plants are suffering from slow growth or color changes. Plant and animal matter such as fish emulsion or fish hydrolysate provides the best type of fertilizer for long-term microbial growth, which keeps soil nutrient-rich and porous. Fertilizers synthesized in laboratories typically feed the plant without improving the soil, and in some cases may even have negative effects. Always protect the hands and face when working with soil additives, as these can contain some bacteria and other health threats. Instead of a manufactured fertilizer, you may be able to find cheaper, unrefined options from a garden supply store or farm. Manure can add nutrients as well as organic matter that will break down and improve the condition of the soil. Here are a few common options:  Manure should be left to decompose for at least a month before use, to avoid damaging plants. Ask if the farmer is using herbicides on their pasture land.  You want to avoid manure from that source, as the herbicide will be present in the manure. Chicken or turkey manure is cheap, but can cause runoff issues in large fields. Cow, sheep, goat, and rabbit manure are higher quality and have a less pungent smell. Add bone meal for phosphorus, or blood meal for nitrogen. . New compost typically takes four to eight months to mature, unless you speed up the process with special bacterial additions. This long term project will greatly benefit both soil texture and nutrients, if you're willing to keep up the process. Set aside a large outdoor container, tightly closed to protect it from animals, but with holes for air flow. Care for it with these techniques:  Begin with about 20% soil, manure, or mature compost; 10 to 30% raw, plant-derived food scraps; and 50 to 70% dry leaves, grass, and yard clippings. Mix these together thoroughly. Keep the compost warm and wet, and throw in raw, non-meat food products from kitchen scraps. Turn the compost with a pitchfork or shovel at least once every week or two, to introduce oxygen that encourages beneficial bacteria. Search for worms in moist areas underneath rocks, and add them to the compost bin. The compost is mature (ready to use) when it clumps together when squeezed, but can easily be broken apart. Plant fibers should still be visible, but the compost should be mostly homogeneous. Try sifting your compost. Compost that falls through the sieve is ready to use. Return larger chunks back to the compost bin. Whether they use solid fertilizer, rotted manure, or compost, most gardeners mix the addition thoroughly into the soil. Many crops do well with a 30% compost, 70% soil mix, but vegetables and fruits often do better with lower amounts of compost. Fertilizer amounts vary greatly depending on the concentration; follow the instructions for your particular plant.  The \"no-till\" or \"no-dig\" gardening movement advocates adding the material to the surface, letting it decompose gradually into the soil. Practitioners consider this a more natural and less invasive way to improve soil, although full results may take years and plentiful organic matter. Add in autumn for best results. Many plants benefit from a \"top up\" every month or two during the growing season, but this varies between species and varieties. If you think the manure or compost may not be rotted enough, keep a circle of regular soil around plants to avoid burning them. There are many trace elements that have a less important or less direct effect, but can cause plant health issues or poor soil if they fall below required levels. If you want to be sure to include these, mix green sand, kelp meal, or Azomite \u00a9 into the soil before planting. For small home gardens, you may not find this necessary unless your plants develop health issues.  The most important trace elements are iron, boron, copper, manganese, molybdenum, and zinc. The additives described here are natural and suitable for organic farming. . If you plant the same type of plant in the same location year after year, it will deplete the soil nutrients more quickly. Some plants will use fewer nutrients or even add nitrogen to the soil, so a rotating schedule of plants each year will keep the nutrient levels more stable.  For home gardening, get started with this simple guide to crop rotation. For farming, consult an experienced local farmer or agricultural extension office, as the rotation plan varies depending on the available crops. Farmers can also consider using overwinter \"cover crops\" grown to provide nutrients for the real crop. Plant a cold-hardy crop at least 30 days before the first expected frost, or 60 days if the crop is only marginally cold-hardy. Mow or cut the crop at least three or four weeks before the regular crop is planted, and leave the cover crop on the ground to decay. You can also plant a quick growing summer cover crop, such as buckwheat. This will allow you to improve and prepare the soil without having to grow a large crop over the entirety of the summer. Till the crop 30 days after planting. If your soil is kept well-aerated and supplied with nutrients, microbe populations will grow on their own, breaking down dead plant matter into nutrients your plants can reuse. For additional soil health, you may be able to purchase bacterial or fungal additions from a garden supply store, if they are suitable for your plant species. Soil that already decomposes rapidly does not need these additions, although there is no hard and fast rule for how much to use or when to stop.  One of the most common additions is a type of fungus called mycorrhizae. This attaches to plant roots and help them absorb more nutrients and water. All plants except members of the genus Brassica (including mustard and cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli and bok choy) benefit from this, unless the soil is already in excellent shape. Bacteria called rhizobium are often already present in the soil, but you can purchase a rhizobium inoculant to be sure. These form a symbiotic relationship with legumes such as potatoes and beans, adding nitrogen to the soil.", "gt_summary": "Check which nutrients your plants need.

It can be done, but your words will have a much better effect if the girl you are talking to can hear the sexy tones in your voice. Try to use your deepest-sounding voice when you talk to your girl. Studies show that men with deep voices have more sexual partners and that females are more attracted to men with deep voices. Now, that doesn't mean you should lower your voice if it sounds unnatural, because that won't turn your girl on. But if you're always in the higher pitched level of your voice, try to go down to the lower level when you're talking with your girl. When you start talking to her, it's important to set the mood for the entire conversation by saying things like \"I can't stop thinking about you,\" or \"I've been wanting to hear your voice all day.\" This will help establish closeness, and let her know that you're feeling intimate. Make sure you\u2019re alone and in a comfortable, sexy environment; you may not want to turn her on in public.  Other things to say are: \"I never knew it until I spent time away from you, but I missed you today,\" or \"You look stunning, as usual.\" Keep it short and sweet; a very elaborate compliment might come off wrong or be misinterpreted by her. Don't compare her to other women. Even if what you're saying is that she's smarter, or prettier, or more fun to be around, avoid the comparison. She doesn't even want you to compare her to other women, because she doesn't want you to think about other women. She wants you to think about only her. If she thinks you may be thinking about other women, it's a turn-off for her. Ask her something that will give her a chance to give a long answer, like \"So tell me about what you did today,\" or \"What exciting things do you have planned for the weekend?\" This will get her talking and will show her that you care.  Asking her a good question will show her that you're interested in what she has to say. Girls want to be sexy and interesting; for her, a good conversation is a way to set the tone. If she answers with a short answer, pepper her with more questions, showing her you care and really want to know. You want to get her on a roll, talking about things she's interested about, all while you're doing a good job listening. Be funny and playful, if you can. Girls love guys with a sense of humor, along with guys who know how to have fun. If you're making her laugh and keeping her on the tips of her toes, it'll be easier to turn her on. Look up and practice some jokes you think she might like, or start developing your own inside jokes with her that you can lean on when you know you need a laugh. If she asks you how your day was, let her know that you were thinking about her. Add a slight twist by complimenting her features. Don't make it too smutty though. Something like \"I couldn't stop thinking about you and your sexy smile\" does the job.  Keep the conversation going by asking questions about her and showing interest in her answers. The way that you start turning her on is by dropping plenty of little compliments. Make sure you think of little things to say just about her to make her feel special. Girls like it when you notice something about them that they also like. So if you know she likes the color of her eyes, compliment the color of her eyes (\"I love the way your eyes shine when you smile\"). If she likes her hair, say something like \"Your hair looks so smooth and comfortable, do you know how pretty it makes you look?\"  Start making the compliments slightly more sexy. If she is saying things like \"Stop!\" or \"You don't mean that\" while giggling, keep giving her the sexy compliments. You're definitely on the right path. Make sure that the things you are saying are sexy and romantic, not dirty and gross. You don\u2019t want to come on too strong when you just start talking about what you want to do; you need to build up anticipation first.  You will need to come up with your own suggestions, but an example might be: \"If we were together, I'd run my fingers slowly through your hair while we kissed. I'd massage your back while I kissed your neck. I would lie next to you and trace my fingers over the soft curves of your beautiful body.\" etc. Be creative. Using lots of imagery and imaginative words can also help. Here are some other compliments that you can use: \"I thought about you when I woke up today. Just like I thought about you when I went to sleep last night. You know what I was thinking about? I was thinking about us, together, curled up in bed. That makes me happy.\" Something else you might say: \"You give me goosebumps. Every time you touch me I go crazy inside, because I know it's only you who can do that to me. No one else does that. Even a smile from you is like a punch in the gut, but in a good way.\" In your own way, make her feel like the sexiest woman alive. Get her thinking sexy thoughts about you and it's guaranteed that she won\u2019t stop thinking about you when the conversation is over. This is the most important thing when it comes to turning your girl on; you don\u2019t want her to feel like a piece of meat.

Next time you are washing your polyester garments, add a capful of your favorite fabric softener to help reduce the build-up of static. The fabric softeners are positively charged, so they will bond with the negative charge found in the polyester clothes, which helps balance and neutralize static buildup. The friction created when garments rub together in a dry environment, like a tumble dryer, can cause electrical charges to cling to the fabric, which creates static electricity. To help minimize static, add a couple of dryer sheets to your tumble dryer. As the sheets heat up, they release and oil that then lightly coats the polyester clothing.

The excitement of doing something different can help replace the urge to masturbate, and you'll have a go-to distraction next time you're tempted. Try some of these options:   Be creative. The process of turning sexual urges into creative output (called sublimation) is something on which monks and sages have relied upon for centuries.  Start writing, learn to play a musical instrument, paint, draw, or do whatever else makes you feel like you're doing something productive.  Play sports. It takes discipline and persistence to excel at a sport.  Develop an interest in running or swimming, or a group sport like soccer, football, basketball, or tennis. Also, any form of exercise will help you relieve tension, feel happier, and make you focus on your physicality in a positive way. Yoga is another form of exercise that can help you feel more relaxed and less likely to feel the sudden urge to masturbate.  Eat a healthy diet. Fruits and vegetables have healthy effects on the body and provide nutrients necessary to increase your energy to make you more active throughout the day. Minimize consumption of aphrodisiac foods, such as oysters, salmon, chili peppers, coffee, avocados, banana, and chocolate.  Find a new hobby, or cultivate a skill. Learning something that takes a while to master can refocus your brain on the delayed gratification of achieving goals instead of the instant gratification of masturbation. Try skills like cooking, woodshop, archery, baking, public speaking, or gardening.  Volunteer your time. Devote your energy to helping teens who've been less fortunate than you, such as working at a shelter, tutoring low-income students, cleaning up blighted areas, or raising money for a good cause. You'll get an altruistic feeling from helping others, and you'll have less time to stray from your goals.  Get enough sleep. Urges to masturbate can be exceedingly strong, so make sure you have enough energy to fight those urges. Try to get at least 8 hours of sleep. If you frequently forget to go to bed at a reasonable hour, set an alarm to remind you. If you have problems before going to bed or in the shower, refrain from any temptation to masturbate. For instance, if it's a problem late at night, drop to the floor and do push-ups until you're too exhausted to do anything but fall asleep. If you find shower time too tempting, start using ice cold water only \u2014\u00a0you won't want to be in there for long; cold shower will offer the added benefit of saving you time and water.  If you always masturbate when you get home from school, make sure to have a solid plan to stave off any boredom you may feel. If you have so little to do that your mind frequently wanders to sexual thoughts, occupy your schedule. You'll find it gets easier to avoid masturbation if you're too busy or tired to spare any energy for distractions. If you're tempted to masturbate in the morning, try to sleep with more than just one layer of clothing so touching yourself is more of an effort. If you masturbate frequently because you feel lonely, find ways to be as socially engaged as possible. This means that you should join as many clubs or activities as you can, accept and give more invitations to people, and go out of your way to make more friends. If you want to date someone, consider asking a friend to set you up or join an online dating site.  Another thing you can do is to limit the times when you are likely to be home alone. If you tend to masturbate in the hour or two before your parents get home from work, go for a walk during that time, or do your homework in a coffee shop. Even if all of your friends are busy, you can still limit your impulse to masturbate by going out in public. For instance, instead of watching the game at home by yourself, watch it at a sports bar. Even if you're not hanging out with friends, you will not be alone, ultimately having no time for masturbation. One of the reasons you may be masturbating so much is that you know that you can access porn within seconds if you desire. However, if you don't have the willpower to stop looking at the porn on your own, then you may have to take other measures to get the job done:  Consider installing porn-blocking software on your computer. Of course you will know the password to bypass the blocking function, but just having it pop up will remind you of your priorities. You can also type a random password in a text file, copy and paste it when you enter your password and verify it, then delete the text file. Then, you will not be able to know the password of your own porn-blocker. This is the best way to keep you strong and spare you the struggle. If you have the tendency to masturbate looking at porn on the computer, try moving your computer into a room where others can see you. If you have a physical collection of porn, dispose of it ASAP (as soon as possible). Stopping a masturbation addiction won't hit you like a lightning bolt. It's a process that requires commitment, and you might make mistakes or relapse on occasions.  The real struggle is persevering, so commit now that you won't let little mistakes stand in your way.

For the character\u2019s thoughts, you could choose a multitude of topics, related or unrelated. This could include people, events, dreams, emotions, activities, items, or anything else. It\u2019s sometimes easier to start with a broader topic if it\u2019s the first time you\u2019ve written stream-of-consciousness.  Literally any topic will do, as long as you have something to say about it \u2013 even if it doesn't seem like much at first. Using this method, you can connect topics that seem unrelated. For example, you could begin discussing a certain character who loves roses and then immediately switch to a childhood memory of your mother\u2019s rose bushes. This is the way thoughts often work in our heads \u2013 so it is also a great way to show how a character thinks and connects ideas in their mind. You don\u2019t need to capitalize, punctuate, or even spell correctly.  If necessary, make up a word to suit your needs. The point is to get your creative juices flowing, not to focus on line-editing what you write or how you are portraying your character\u2019s thoughts. Remember that the point of this style of writing is to mirror how thoughts naturally flow through our heads, and people don\u2019t typically think in complete sentences with perfect grammar. Ignore sentence structure. You could do an entire page of adjectives, verbs, or nouns related to your topic. Or you could do short phrases, or whatever else comes to mind, as long as it illustrates the character\u2019s thought patterns in a pointed, methodical way. Spend some time away from the writing so that you can look over it with fresh eyes. Think about what you wrote and if it seems to be accomplishing the goal you set out to achieve. Go through several drafts if you plan to use your writing for a formal paper or reorganize your ideas so they make cohesive sense.  Switch tasks for a little while before coming back to your writing. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a few hours or a few days as long as you come back to your writing with a fresh outlook. This type of writing can allow you to provide interesting insights or connections that people normally wouldn\u2019t see. It\u2019s valuable to save this work for future reference to look back over what kinds of connections you made between ideas. Even if it\u2019s weird or bad, make sure you save your writing.

This form of writing is meant to replicate the fast-flowing, free-associating way our brains automatically work when we are thinking inside our own heads.

As such, address any acne soon after it appears on your face or any other exposed area you don't want blemishes. However, don't prick or squeeze pimples or try to extract blackheads forcefully or prematurely. Instead, keep the pores of your skin clean with cleansing soap or facial wash and wait until the white-headed pustule (dead white blood cells) or blackhead (compacted oil and dirt) comes closer to the surface of the skin. Once that occurs, gently exfoliate it away with a mildly abrasive moistened facial pad, or carefully squeeze it with the sides of your clean fingers or sanitized metal tool designed for the task.  Try an over-the-counter facial wash containing 2% salicylic acid or 5-10% benzoyl peroxide. You can also try baking soda and lemon for gentle and natural exfoliation and blemish fading treatment. Lemon juice has a bleaching effect, so it may be helpful for reducing the appearance of blemishes. Try to get all of the pus or blackhead material out of the pore, as it will heal quicker. Disinfect the inflamed pore immediately afterwards with some antiseptic solution, preferably one that is alcohol-free. Don't squeeze pimples or blackheads with your fingernails because the surrounding tissue can get damaged and infected \u2014 a major cause of post-acne blemishes. Many dermatologists recommend not popping or squeezing your own blemishes. Instead, they suggest leaving it to a skin specialist. Sun block is one of the most important measures to prevent acne as well as fade the related blemishes. Radiation from the sun not only irritates acne in some cases, but it can sunburn sensitive tissue associated with inflamed or healing pimples, causing discoloration (hyper-pigmentation, the darkening of the skin) and leading to long-term blemish marks. Hyper-pigmentation of the skin occurs due to increased production of melanin, which is responsible for the skins pigment or color. Aside from sun exposure, other common causes of skin hyper-pigmentation include pregnancy, hormone imbalance, certain skin diseases and side effects from taking certain medications.  To combat sun damage and hyper-pigmentation, apply an oil-free moisturizer with sunscreen (SPF of at least 15) on your exposed skin, especially your face. The best sunscreens to use to protect from darkening blemishes are those that contain either titanium or zinc oxide. To further protect your face, considered wearing a wide-brimmed hat when in the sun, particularly at the beach or near bodies of water. Keep in mind that some acne medications and antibiotics may make your skin more susceptible to sunburn. So if you're on medication, consult with your doctor or pharmacist to determine whether you need to be more proactive in avoiding sun exposure. In addition to trying to prevent blemishes, there are many types of chemicals that can help fade them. For examples, hydroquinone and 8-hydroxyquinoline are both skin lightening agents that can quickly fade acne marks, dark age spots and hyper-pigmentation. Although applying over-the-counter creams with 2% hydroquinone can be effective for fading blemishes fairly quickly (within a few weeks), it can also cause skin sensitivity and lighten normal skin surrounding the blemish. Topical 8-hydroxyquinoline is a good alternative to hydroquinone as it works by targeting pigment clusters and helps lighten blemishes and dark spots without whitening or fading surrounding skin.  Topical hydroquinone is sometimes combined with alpha hydroxy acids that exfoliate the skin in order to quicken the lightening process. Benzoyl peroxide also bleaches skin, but it has many other properties that help combat blemishes too (see below). A more natural and inexpensive lightening agent for blemishes is regular 3% hydrogen peroxide, which is widely available in pharmacies. Hydrogen peroxide is also effective at killing bacteria and preventing skin infections, but be prepared for a slight stinging sensation when you apply it. Some creams contain alpha and beta hydroxy acids which can also help to even skin tone and lighten blemishes. In addition to whitening agents, another way to fade blemishes is to exfoliate (remove) the dead skin layers covering the hyper-pigmented mark. Exfoliating agents include manual exfoliants such as walnut shell, hydrated silica, or sand and chemical exfoliants such as alpha hydroxy acids, which remove dead skin cells and encourage new cell turnover. As such, the blemish discoloration fades and becomes a little less noticeable each time you exfoliate and reveal newer, clearer skin. Benzoyl peroxide also removes dead skin cells, as well as kills bacteria and removes excess oil from skin pores. Keep in mind that these compounds cause dead skin to be shed from the blemish and very little or no physical scrubbing is needed. Consequently, it's best to apply these products (as ointments, lotions or creams) in the evening before bedtime and let them work overnight.  Benzoyl peroxide products are available in strengths from 2.5% - 10% and may also sting upon skin application. Common side effects include dry skin, scaling and redness. Alpha hydroxy acids are synthetic compounds derived from citrus fruit. The two alpha hydroxy acids used in nonprescription acne products are glycolic acid and lactic acid.  Glycolic acid peel can be helpful in fading blemishes. Jessner peel is one of the best treatments to fade blemishes.  It generally contains salicylic acid, lactic acid, and resorcinol. It can also decrease fine lines, wrinkles and soften acne scars.   Salicylic acid and sulfur compounds are also exfoliators which clean pores and prevent them from getting clogged. Nonprescription salicylic acid products are available in strengths from 0.5% - 5%, whereas sulfur compounds are typically combined with salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide. Even when combining compounds that have numerous helpful properties (benzoyl peroxide with salicylic acid, for example), it can still take between 4-8 weeks to see significant fading of blemishes. Aside from pharmaceutical products, there are numerous herbal or plant-based remedies that have a well-established track record for being able to combat skin blemishes. These natural alternatives can sometimes prevent blemishes (due to antibacterial and immune stimulating properties) or fade existing marks and spots either by lightening the skin, exfoliating it and/or reducing inflammation. Commonly used natural remedies for blemishes include: tea tree oil extract, lemon / lime extracts, azelaic acid cream, licorice root extract, raw (unripe) papaya fruit, green tea extract and aloe vera gel. Apply these products directly to your blemish, preferably at night, and give it a few weeks before making a judgement on effectiveness.  For active (acute) and inflamed blemishes, aloe vera may be your best bet because of its anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties, as well as its powerful ability to heal skin.  Anecdotal reports suggest that rubbing a piece of raw potato on your skin blemishes 2-3x daily may reduce hyper-pigmentation. It's certainly safe for most people, cheap and worth an experiment if you're on a budget. Mixing together natural compounds which have complimenting properties is a smart idea. Try mixing raw honey (antiseptic properties), with fresh squeezed lemon juice (contains natural whitening acids and vitamin C) and turmeric powder (strong anti-oxidant with anti-inflammatory properties).

Terrain Type. Choose between two terrain types, namely Valleys and Mountains.  Valleys are great for beginners as they have more flat land and forests which make for great building spaces and resources respectively. Mountains have a lot of uneven ground which makes constructing buildings difficult. Also, getting through one side of a mountain to the other requires tunnels that demand a lot of resources.    Terrain Size. Choose the size of your map, from Small, Medium, and Large. Any will do, but most players prefer Medium.  Climate. Climate determines the level of climate change in your game. Mild has shorter winters; Harsh has longer, earlier cold days; and Fair is somewhere in between. Choosing Harsh may mean starvation as farming becomes impossible. Fair is a good choice for starting gamers.  Disasters. This activates the possibility of disasters in your village, such as tornadoes sweeping across town and fire spreading to nearby buildings.  There will be starvation, or possible death even, when food is scarce. Freezing occurs when there isn't enough firewood or coal to heat homes.

Used for the construction and making of tools, it is found around the map and can be harvested, or you can build a mine for constant supply.  Firewood. Used to heat homes during cold or winter months, chop logs into firewood with a Woodcutter.  Coal. Gained through mining or by trade, a Blacksmith can make steel tools out of it. It can also be an alternate heat source to firewood.  Leather. Gained from operating a Hunting Cabin or by slaughtering cattle in pasture, use it to make clothes to help your people work and stay outside longer during winter.  Wool. Gained from pasturing sheep, use it to make clothing.  Food. It is produced by Gatherers, Fishermen, Hunters, Crop Fields, Pastures, and Orchards.  Herbs.

The use of a schedule helps depression by counteracting the loss of motivation, hopelessness, and decreasing time for rumination, which are all associated with depression.   Rumination is the activity of replaying a scenario or problem in your head over and over, like a broken record. While some people consider rumination as a form of problem-solving (\"I'm thinking through this problem from every angle until I come up with a solution\"), if the problem is upsetting, you will end up continuing to be upset until you stop thinking about it.  Find a day planner that has space for hourly scheduling. Make sure you plan each hour of your day. Incorporate time for journaling, rest, exercise, relaxation, and self-care. To combat loneliness, schedule time to connect with a social group or a pet. Carry your schedule with you so that you're following it closely. It's important to follow through with each activity, so prepare yourself by knowing what comes next throughout the day. After you have completed your scheduled activities, write down the level of competency you felt about completing the activity, as well as the level of pleasure experienced if any.  This record of competency and pleasure can serve you in the future if you are having thoughts about not being able to get things down or being able to enjoy anything. Refrain from evaluating your activities on an all-or-nothing scale. Instead, try to evaluate on a scale of one to ten, with one being low competency or low pleasure, and ten being maximum competency and maximum pleasure. Self-reliance training is sometimes needed for persons with depression when they have become reliant on friends or family members to take care of daily needs. The process of self-reliance starts with taking back responsibility for self-care.  It is important to begin in one area, scheduling this daily. For instance, you can start with being responsible for showering. You can also record your level of mastery in being responsible for showering. For instance, starting out, you may indicate that you were only able to get out of bed for the day and not shower. This may seem like no mastery at all, but it is more mastery that you previously had. Use your planner and feelings of competence to build yourself back up in self-care. Once you have taken on showering, you can tackle making the bed, then cleaning, etc. It is important to know how and when to use distraction as a helpful method to combat rumination and intense emotions. Have a set of 'go-to' distractions that you can use if you are ruminating, feeling overwhelmed, or feeling lonely.

The temperature may shift and vary. So bring something warm.  Even if you\u2019re going to a warm climate, bringing along a zip-up sweatshirt or a simple cardigan sweater is a good idea. Some knits can look pretty stylish. Dark clothing is better because it will hide spills that could happen on the plane. If you\u2019re traveling in winter, you might want to bring a puffy down jacket if you have one because it won\u2019t wrinkle if you need to place it into the overhead bin.

Not only are those sometimes embarrassing, but it will delay you. Instead, try metal-free bras. A simple padded brassiere could work, and sports bras are perfect for airport travel.

However, wear worn jeans that don\u2019t have too tight of a waistband and are worn in. Celebrities walk through airports all the time, and they manage to look both comfortable and stylish. Try relaxed trousers with a blazer like actress Cate Blanchett. Try jeans with flats and a simple black blouse like the model Miranda Kerr. Loose sweaters are extremely comfortable, especially if you pair them with jeans or leggings. Loose fitting dresses or pants are also a good choice for flying.  A loose sweater will keep you warm and will feel comfortable, including if you end up sitting in the airport or on the plane for hours. If you want to wear a skirt, go with a long maxi skirt and don't choose anything too tight and short. Wear an oversize pashmina scarf with the sweater (or just with a shirt) and it can almost double as a blanket on the plane. The other benefit of loose clothing is that it can help prevent blood clots. Although synthetic clothing can be flammable, it's also less likely to wrinkle, which can make it a good choice for planes. A graphic T-shirt is another option if you\u2019re in a warm climate. It\u2019s casual but still trendy, so you will look stylish without sacrificing comfort. Avoid T-shirts with offensive sayings, though. It could cause you trouble in an airport.

You can remove one layer (say a sweater) and enjoy the tank top underneath once you land somewhere warmer (or vice versa). You should dress for the colder climate if you\u2019re flying between locales with different temperatures. Wearing a Pashmina, shawl, scarves, or wrap can be turned into makeshift pillows, allowing you to sleep more easily on the plane, if necessary.  Get prepared for the plane to be cold at times even if the climate outside is not. You will also want to wear fabrics that breathe and allow air to pass, such as silk or cotton.

You need to have some idea what the position is worth and what your skills are worth in order to navigate the compensation question during an interview.  You can search websites like salary.com, payscale.com, glassdoor.com, and others to find out information about what people are getting paid in equivalent positions. You should also try asking around to various friends and colleagues, especially if they are in a related field, to figure out what an appropriate figure would be. If you are asked about compensation for previous employment, use specific dollar values only if the situation requires them, and do so in a strategic and thoughtful manner. You do not want to appear as though you are boasting or prying into someone else's business.  When in a professional setting such as an employment interview, avoid bringing up previous salary figures. Base your personal salary requirements on your education level, previous experience and skill set, and comparable industry statistics. Come prepared with updated and current data regarding average compensation for someone with your level of qualifications. If the potential employer does ask you to provide a specific dollar value for a desired salary, be honest with your expectations. A common mistake occurs when employees propose a salary lower than they would really want to accept for fear of being turned away by the employer. Whether in a range or a single amount, a prospective employee should never offer an amount less than they are willing to take under the worst situation. A useful strategy is to offer a mid-range figure with the statement that is negotiable depending upon benefits, promotion opportunities, etc. That way, each party can save face. Let the interviewer know that salary requirements are not your only point of interest or concern. This will help you steer the conversation away from a discussion focused solely on dollar amounts. Express to the interviewer that aside from salary, other job-related issues such as career advancement, professional opportunities, or other benefits associated with the position are very important to you.  If a potential employer asks you to disclose the salary level of your current or previous position, do not be afraid to include all forms of compensation. This could include health benefits, 401(k) contributions, profit sharing, or other benefits in addition to your base salary. State the amount of your \"total compensation\" including the value of the benefits package. There is nothing wrong with this strategy, so try not to consider it misleading. In return, be sure to consider all forms of compensation when comparing a competing salary offer to your current or previous position. Employee benefits are an often overlooked but significant portion of a salary offer.", "gt_summary": "Come prepared. Avoid specific dollar amounts when possible.

It can keep you from realizing your true potential because it totalizes you: when you generalize, you\u2019re not a person who makes mistakes, you\u2019re a \u201cfailure.\u201d How could you feel motivated to realize your true potential when you feel that way?  For example, perhaps you are trying to invent the next great technology and it hasn\u2019t worked yet. You\u2019ve tried 7 experiments and all of them have failed. You could generalize from this instance and say, \u201cI\u2019ll never get this work because I\u2019m such a loser.\u201d A better way to handle this would be to think, \u201cThis experiment didn\u2019t work. That\u2019s okay, now I have even more information on what doesn\u2019t work, so I can try something else that might.\u201d You are not a failure. You are a person who is learning from her mistakes so she can keep developing. This thought trap can hold you back by distorting your focus. When you filter, you focus only on the negative aspects of a situation, ignoring the positives.  For example, you might get comments back on a school essay that are 70% positive, but you can only focus on the three things that your teacher said needed work and ignore the rest. Challenge yourself to look at the situation as an outsider might. Try to list the facts of the situation as objectively as you can. In this case, you could remind yourself: \u201cOut of the ten comments my teacher gave me, seven of them were complimentary. The three things that need work are things that I can work on. These negative comments don\u2019t discount the positive ones.\u201d All-or-nothing thinking often means death to achievement, because achievement usually isn\u2019t perfect straight out of the gate. When you give in to all-or-nothing thinking, you don\u2019t allow yourself any middle ground. Either your effort is perfect or it\u2019s a failure.  For example, if you want to master the violin, all-or-nothing thinking would accept nothing less than perfection. It doesn\u2019t allow you room to celebrate your growth as you get better and better at playing a piece; it just judges you for all the mistakes you make along the way. Instead, remind yourself that perfection is an unrealistic standard that no one can meet. A single negative experience or mistake doesn\u2019t negate your progress. Extend this generosity to yourself and to others. Catastrophizing is another thought trap that can keep you from realizing your true potential. When we catastrophize, we allow our thoughts to spiral out of control. We expect that the absolute worst will happen. This can make us so afraid that it keeps us from allowing ourselves to be vulnerable enough to truly succeed.  For example, realizing your true potential might mean leaving an unhappy relationship. But, you think, what if I never find anyone else to love? I\u2019ll wind up living alone. I\u2019ll be unhappy the rest of my life. I\u2019ll wind up getting eaten by my cats when I die alone in my apartment that nobody visits me in. One way to challenge catastrophizing is to require yourself to find evidence for each \u201cleap\u201d you make. Is it really likely that you will never find anyone to love? No. There are billions of people in the world, so chances are there is more than one you could be happy with. Is it true that if you live alone you must end up lonely and eaten by cats? No. Plenty of people live by themselves and still have full, rewarding social lives. This thought trap makes you feel as though you have to live up to others\u2019 standards. It can hold you back from your true potential because you\u2019re basing your actions on what you feel you \u201cshould\u201d do rather than what feels right for you to do.  For example, perhaps you have been told that you \u201cshould\u201d have children by a certain age. You might feel like you\u2019re a failure if you have passed that age and have not had children. But consider: do you actually want to have children, or have them right now? Or were you allowing that \u201cshould\u201d to make you feel bad about yourself? As long as you are living according to your values, others\u2019 \u201cshoulds\u201d don\u2019t matter. When you find yourself thinking things that involve should/must/ought, think about where that thought is coming from. If you find it coming from a fear or pressure from someone else, challenge that thought. For example, if you think, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have that cookie today because I should lose weight,\u201d think: do you feel like you should lose weight because your doctor has told you it would be healthy? Or do you feel pressured by society\u2019s standards? If it\u2019s the former, reframe it as a positive goal: \u201cI won\u2019t have that cookie today because I\u2019m working toward getting healthier.\u201d If it\u2019s the latter, show yourself kindness: \u201cI will have that cookie because I love myself just as I am, and I don\u2019t need to conform to anyone else\u2019s expectations.\u201d", "gt_summary": "Recognize and challenge generalization.

Soldering is used to bind two components together and is a useful tool for electronics and plumbing work.'\n\nLong Document: 'Put into basic terms, soldering is the process of melting a metal onto other metal components in order to bind them. Soldering differs from welding. In welding, the component pieces are melted together; in soldering, a softer metal with a lower melting point is used to connect them. Because soldering doesn't melt components, it's useful for more delicate applications, such as electronics work, or plumbing. The purpose of soldering is to bind two other components. Solder can be thought of as a sort of \u201cmetal glue.\u201d It can be used to fill in gaps or hold pieces in place, but doesn't serve any more complicated purpose. Since solder is metallic, it conducts electricity, which is another reason it's so popular for connecting electronic components. Solder is the name of the actual material used in soldering. Historically, many solders contained lead or cadmium, but that has been recently phased"

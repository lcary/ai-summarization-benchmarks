Take some time to make a list of qualities that you hope your next girlfriend will have, such as:  Easygoing. A team player. Positive, optimistic, and upbeat. Energetic and fun. Intelligent and thoughtful. Affectionate and loving. Passionate and driven. You don\u2019t have to have everything in common with your significant other, but having some things in common is often helpful for a successful relationship. Try to identify your biggest interests to determine some things that you want your next girlfriend to also care about. For example, you might list:  Music, such as rock, country, rap, or classical. Reading literature, the newspaper, or poetry. Sports, such as basketball, football, running, or baseball. Playing an instrument or singing. Going to the movies or playing video games. After you have constructed some lists that expand on your definition of a sweet girl, you can use these lists to help you find her. Read over the traits and interests you have listed, then think about where a girl like this might spend her time.  For example, you might determine that a girl who shares your love of music will probably frequent local concerts and music stores. Therefore, be on the lookout the next time you go to one of these places.

Polyurethane and polyester will result in a harder, more plastic-feeling finish on your guitar while nitrocellulose is lighter and thinner. If you're unsure of what kind of paint to get, look for spray paint that's made specifically for guitars. This is to prevent the paint from building up and making it real hard getting the neck reinstalled. The neck joint is the most critical cut on any guitar. Make sure you tape this off very well. Position the nozzle on the spray can 12 to 18 inches (30.48 to 45.72 cm) away from the body of the guitar. Remember to cover the edges of the guitar. Press down on the button on the spray can and go in long, sweeping back and forth motions across the body of the guitar. Touch the surface of the guitar to make sure that none of the paint transfers to your hand. The paint may still be sticky and you'll still be able to see the sealer under the basecoat that you just sprayed. Once the guitar is dry, flip it over and spray down the other side of the guitar. You should now have one solid basecoat of paint over the front and back of your guitar. Allow each coat of paint to dry for five minutes before applying the next coat. Continue flipping the guitar over so that the entire guitar gets even coverage. Continue to cover your guitar in coats of paint until the paint gets darker and richer. This could take anywhere from three to seven coats of paint. Once you're done laying down the base color for your guitar, you'll have to let the paint dry for another one or two days in a well-ventilated area. Once it's completely dry, you can move onto the next step. Once the color coat is dry, run your fingers over the surface, sides, and back of the guitar to see if the paint is smooth. If the paint rises too high in some spots or has become bumpy, you should sand it down with a wet sandpaper. Saturate the sandpaper in water overnight, then work it along the rough parts of your guitar while it's still wet. Wet sandpaper will not scratch the surface of your guitar. Clear lacquer paint will give your guitar a shiny finish over the paint. You can purchase clear lacquer paint at a home improvement store or online. Spray the clear lacquer the same way you sprayed the base coat, putting four separate coats of lacquer on the guitar and letting the paint dry for 90 minutes in between sprays. Don't touch your guitar for three weeks as the paint dries. During this time, the paint will cure and should be a rich solid color, but will be missing the polish that guitars typically have. Saturate a rag or cloth with car polish and work it on the surface of the guitar using small, circular motions. This should refine the shine in the guitar and make it more reflective. Finish off the guitar by buffing off the remaining polish with a clean rag. Reinstall the shielding in the electronics bay.

If they really want you, they are going to try to figure out how much you want them. If this is asked directly, or even indirectly, it may be a very good sign.  For example, an interviewer might ask, \"What did you think when you first learned about this position?\" This is an indirect way to gauge your enthusiasm. Alternatively, they may ask \"What attracted you to this job?\" Discussions of salary, initiated by the company, usually do not emerge unless the prospect of hiring you is realistic. If your interviewer brings up the subject of salary, it can be a sign towards the positive.  This is particularly true if they are extending a salary offer. Before your interview, spend some thinking about what level of salary you will bargain for. You can review salaries for similar positions at sites like PayScale, Glassdoor, and Monster. One nearly indisputable sign that you are in the running for the job is a request for second interview. Many times this will occur at the end of your interview, and other times they will call and set it up later. In any case, a second interview insures that you have made it to the short list for this job.  A second interview means that they have narrowed it down to a few strong candidates who will be interviewed again. You will want to be as prepared as you can for your second interview (do some research on the company, prepare some good questions to ask, and try to anticipate what they might ask you). By the second interview, you should have previously reviewed the company through Internet and social media searches. However, you need to review their previous information and check for any news since the first interview. Often times, interviewers will not ask for references unless they actually intend to contact them. So a request for professional references can be a very good sign! That said, many HR departments have already received resumes with references, so a lack of questions is not a negative signal.  Be sure to have a list of references ready when you head to your interview. Type up your reference list and bring it along with another copy of your resume. In most cases, the interviewer will have asked more in-depth questions about your current job, past experiences, and/or education. Your answers should have tied these experiences to the duties and competencies required of you in the new job. It is a particularly good sign if the conversation moved to a problem that the company has and how your experience and skills can be used to solve it. This means that the interviewer can imagine you filling the position. If this come up in the interview, remember to reinforce the idea in your follow-up correspondence. Once again, a truly interested employer will be working to gauge your interest in the position. As such, they may come right out and ask you about any other job prospects you have in the works. This is an excellent sign that they\u2019d love to have you aboard!  For example, an interviewer may simply ask, \"Have you interviewed for any other positions?\" If asked this, it is best to be honest.

It's pretty hard to be enthusiastic about life when you're living someone else's. Not being yourself is just so draining; no wonder it's hard to muster up enthusiasm. In order to channel that gusto, you gotta be yourself first and foremost. Pretending to be something you're not takes up all your resources you could be using on doing what you actually enjoy and could get excited about. A lot of us try super hard to fit into a mold that society has deemed correct. Boo. We're not going to enjoy the things our friends enjoy, we're not going to get fulfillment out of the things that fulfill others. So don't waste your time! It's only when you're naturally you that you can find what drives you and grab a firm hold. Then you can work on being enthusiastic. You're on this page for a reason. Most likely someone around you is giving you crap about your lack of energy. Very few people look objectively at themselves and say, \"Hmm. I wonder why I'm not peppier.\" But whatever your reason, you probably have an inkling as to why. Is it your job? Your love life? Or is it more of a universal, 24/7 thing that's dragging you down? It's natural to get stuck in a rut. These things happen. They also end at some point. But then there's clinical depression and that's a whole other can of worms. If it's something you've never thought about, think about it now. Is it a lack of enthusiasm or is it a bigger issue? What's your gut tell you? If someone handed you a math test and said, \"Here's the exam. It's stuff you didn't even dream of touching in college. Good luck, kid,\" how might that feel? Pretty daunting, probably. If instead they said, \"Here's the exam -- it's gonna be tough, but it's doable,\" what would you think then? You'd be a lot more motivated and feel a lot better about taking that exam! The same goes for enthusiasm; you're not gonna get excited about something if it's terrible! Think about it. How easy is it to be excited about something that's doable and that you know you're capable of achieving? It's a lot harder to get enthusiastic about things that we straight up don't think will ever materialize. And what's often the difference? Our way of thinking. Sometimes, that's literally the only obstacle. Now that you're at least trying to think positive, what are the goals that you'd like to achieve? How would you go about achieving them? What do you want to be enthusiastic about? It's hard to be enthusiastic when we're floundering about life without purpose. Knowing exactly what you want to do and exactly how you want to go about it is giving you something to be enthusiastic about. If you want to get skinny, it's hard to be enthusiastic about wanting to get skinny. But if you're working out 30 minutes a week and eating tons of veggies, that's direct behavior to get excited about. It's all well and good to have goals, but you gotta actually believe that you can achieve them. If your goal is too lofty, bring it down a notch. Bring it down a notch until you can readily believe that it's something you can make happen. If it's realistic, the only thing stopping you is you. Having a goal of becoming the King or Queen of England would be pretty damn hard to get excited about. Make sure your goals are feasible -- if in doubt, just start on a slightly smaller scale. Want to start your own business but don't know thing one about it? Make goals of taking business courses and networking. Smaller things that are totally doable and totally useful. Often when we're not enthusiastic, it's because we've made up some excuse as to why not to be. We don't want to be enthusiastic because we don't want to get our hopes up, we're not enthusiastic because we're too unsure to be enthusiastic, or we're not enthusiastic because we're worried others will judge us. These are all crap reasons! Your enthusiasm should be undaunted and unaffected by others or by insecurities. What's stopping you? Realize that your desire to be enthusiastic is there -- it's just buried under a pile of worry and fear. When we grow up, often adults call that \"reason.\" It's very much so a learned thing.

This should be the one that you focus your efforts on. After choosing your best idea, start implementing steps to make it a reality. There are several different structures your business can take on. Each one has unique characteristics that will affect how you write your business plan, as well as your legal status. Some different options are a sole proprietorship, a limited liability corporation, and a partnership, to name a few. See the U.S. Small Business Association site for a full breakdown of these options and others to decide which one is best for you. When you've decided on which idea you'll focus your efforts on, you'll need a business plan before moving on. A business plan defines your company, the service it provides, and projects the company's potential costs and earnings. This will not only help you focus and organize your own ideas, but it is also essential for investors to see how profitable your business can be. Read Write a Business Plan for detailed instructions on creating an optimum plan. Unless you're independently wealthy, you won't be able to implement your business idea without financing. After drawing up your business plan, you'll have to present it to investors to acquire the capital to start your business. You usually have two choices for getting capital: banks and private investors. Both have strengths and weaknesses, and you'll probably end up using a combination of both.  Banks. You can get a loan from a bank for a few months to a few years, depending on the type of loan. This can cover your opening costs and your first few months of operating expenses. Private investors. These can be friends, family, or other business owners interested in making an investment.

This is a saw that is made to cut live wood, as opposed to a wood saw that is made to cut dry lumber. Not all white pine trees need to be pruned on a regular basis. In general, trees younger than 25 years old benefit from pruning more than older trees do. When a tree is young, pruning can be used to train the tree to grow in a uniform way. However, when a tree gets older, it should be trimmed only when it has broken branches or some other acute issue.  Also, very young trees that are less than a few feet tall should not be pruned. Let the tree get established for a year or two before you start cutting its branches. This does not mean that you can't prune an older tree. It simply means that once a white pine tree is very established, it is basically maintenance free. White pine trees should be trimmed in the late fall, winter, or early spring. This is when they are not expending a lot of energy on growth so they can easily recover from trimming.

If you develop a cramp in your side, you are not breathing deeply enough to provide oxygen to your diaphragm. When you inhale, fill your lungs all the way to the bottom. Think of it as drawing air into your stomach rather than your chest. Your lungs are deep! Take deep and complete breaths. Quick, shallow breaths do not fill your lungs all the way and can also cause you to become lightheaded. If you are having trouble taking deep breaths, slow down your pace for a few moments while your lungs catch up. Always provide your body with enough water, especially if you're sweating. When you sweat, you lose salt and water, which can throw off the balance of electrolytes and salt in your body. This causes your cells to swell, which causes calcium to stick to them, making the muscle contraction remain. You can prevent this by drinking enough water.

Don't overdo it, but keep a water bottle handy for a few hours after your workout. Take care not to drink too much water.

The first step to multiplying fractions is to line them up so that their numerators and denominators are next to each other. If you're multiplying the fraction 1/2 by 12/48, then the first thing you want to do is multiply the numerators, 1 and 12. 1 x 12 = 12. Write the product, 12, in the numerator of the answer. Now, you'll just have to do the same thing with the denominators. Multiply 2 and 48 to find the new denominator. 2 x 48 = 96. Write this answer in the denominator of the new fraction. Therefore, the new fraction is 12/96. . The last step is to simplify the result if it can be done. To simplify a fraction, you have to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of both the numerator and the denominator. The GCF is the largest number that can be evenly divided into both numbers. In the case of 12 and 96, 12 happens to evenly divide into 96. So, divide 12 by 12 to get 1, and divide 96 by 12 to get 8. Therefore, 12/96 \u00f7 12/12 = 1/8.

If you try to compare yourself to other people, it will not affect your self esteem well, because you can always find someone who is stronger, smarter, or prettier than you. Instead, focus on being the person that you want to become, not like your neighbor, the \"cool\" people in your school, your job, or your neighborhood. Once you define your own version of success, you'll be able to achieve it. You may feel like everyone around you has it better than you do. However, you probably forget all of your amazing strengths. You may not even realize all of the things you have going for you and that someone else wants to be more like you. Confidence is the key to feeling good about yourself and loving the person you are and will become. You can make an effort to feel confident in who you are and what you can achieve, although it might take time. You have to remind yourself that you're an amazing person and that you deserve to be confident in yourself. If you think you're worth it, then you are.  To look more confident, perk up your body language. Stand taller, have better posture, and look straight ahead instead of at the ground. Try to sit still or stand with an open demeanor to give off a more positive, approachable vibe. Find something to really excel at or work on excelling in something you already love. If you are already great at something, focus on how amazing you are for being able to do those things. Try to focus on your abilities and how capable you are. You'll feel better about yourself if you're good at something that you love. When you're entering an unknown situation, focus on the best thing that can possibly happen instead of what can go wrong. Every person has something that they can feel good about. Take the time to sit down and make a list of all of the things you love about yourself. Force yourself to sit there until you fill a whole page. Dig deep to find things that really make you an amazing person. Think of qualities like your compassion, your sense of humor, your trustworthy character, or your work ethic. The longer and more sincere the list, the better.  Some qualities to describe yourself might be loving, studious, hardworking, friendly, strong, clever, sharp, easygoing, and fun. You can also add things about your physical appearance that you like as well, as long as they are sincerely important to you. You want to cover every aspect of you in this list. You should also add to the list any time you think of something else you're proud of. Keep this list nearby and consult it often to continue feeling good. You can even fold it up and put it in your wallet.  If you are having trouble making this list yourself, consult people who know you well. Ask your friends or coworkers to describe your strengths; some of them might surprise you! Sometimes you just have to live with the bad feelings and understand that they pass. People think that, to feel good about themselves, they have to feel amazing 100% of the time. If you're having a bad day, especially if it's after a string of great days, then avoid putting yourself down about it and know that this too will pass.  If you feel extremely sad, be sure to talk someone who cares about you and who will listen to your problems. If you have felt very sad for at least half a year, consult a medical professional. When you're in a bad mood, your body also knows it. Think about which part of your body gets out of whack when you're crabby or upset. If you recognize your body's signals, you may be able to figure out what's bothering you and make yourself feel better. This can be difficult. It may take time to be positive all the time, but you can make it more a part of your life. Developing a positive attitude is a decision you have to make yourself, and stick to every day. If you have a more positive attitude, then you'll feel better about yourself, as well as your future prospects and all that you can accomplish.  You can work on recognizing when your thoughts are overly negative and turn them around to lead yourself to a healthier mindset. For every negative thought that crosses your mind, fight it with at least two or three positive thoughts. For example, if you think, \"I look so tired today,\" you can say, \"But my hair looks pretty great and I still have an amazing smile.\" Be compassionate toward yourself. Talk to  yourself like you would the person/animal  you most love when you're hurting inside. On a deeper level, if you think something like, \"I am just so awkward in social situations,\" you should say, \"But I usually know how to make people laugh and people seem really comfortable around me.\" Work at it every day. Even if your attitude goes unnoticed, practice your positive attitude. You never know how large a difference it can make, and practice will make it easier to do. Practice talking about yourself positively to your friends. Talk about something you've accomplished or something you're excited about. You'll find that your optimism is contagious, and that you'll feel better about yourself just by talking about it out loud. If your friends do not like talking about the good parts of your life, consider if these people truly make you happy and feel good about yourself. Decide on the significance of things before deciding to get upset. For example, many people get upset with unexpected, bad traffic. However, only sometimes Even if you feel like no one needs you or that you are not helpful, this is rarely the case. Talk to your loved ones to see how needed you really are and how much people appreciate you. Let your family members or friends know how you're feeling, and they'll come back at you with a list of all of the amazing qualities that you posses. Talk to your friends about your problems and they'll tell you underestimate yourself and that they need you in their lives.  The more you remember that you're a worthy person who anyone is lucky to know, the sooner you'll realize that you have so much to offer. And if you feel valued, then you'll be on your way to feeling better about yourself.  Even if you are currently in a difficult phase of life, you still have the potential to expand upon some interests and become really passionate or skilled at something. You might even offer to ability to share your passion with others. These are all valid reasons to feel good about yourself. Don't forget the compassionate self dialogue during these times. You may feel bad about yourself because you feel like you have absolutely nothing to be happy about. Feeling bad about yourself has to do with your perception of who you are and with how you feel about your surroundings. Start making a gratitude list and write down all of the things you're thankful for, from your health to your siblings to the lovely weather outside. This will help you see that you can feel good because there is so much joy, luck, and hope all around you.  Treat this list like the list of qualities you love about yourself. Fill a whole page and read it over often, adding to it whenever you think of something else.  If it is difficult for you to find things to be grateful for, turn this into a positivity exercise. Think of what you are mad about, and push yourself to find 2 good things about every bad situation. For example, you can counter \u201cI\u2019m mad that the dog barking woke me and the baby up at 5am today.\u201d with \u201c1. I spent some bonding time with my son this morning, calming him down; every moment I have with my son is special; and 2. I got to hear the birds chirp as the sun rose.\u201d If you are still struggling, ask others what they are thankful for. You might have something in common. Everyone is beautiful in their own special way. It's fine to want to see what's changing and to daydream about who you're becoming. But your self-esteem should rely mostly upon your personal qualities and character; not your physical appearance. If you want to feel good about yourself, then your main priority should be who you are; and if it\u2019s related, then what you look like. But do make exercise a regular part of your life. You'll feel stronger physically and emotionally.  Limit your prep time. If you spend all your time wishing you looked perfect, then you will focus on less positive, constructive areas of your life. Determine how much time you will spend doing your hair and makeup and looking in the mirror before you go out. Find a routine that fits into that amount of time. If you spend any more time than that on yourself, you are bound to find flaws where none exist. You have much more self worth aside from your appearance. You should take strength and confidence from your actions and achievements instead of your appearance. For example, you have an amazing day where you get commended for a project you have spent weeks working on. When you get home, you finally get a chance to look in the mirror and realize you had mascara smeared under your eye. Despite the fact that you had a smudge on your face, you still accomplished something great and you should be confident in your abilities. If people compliment you based on your looks, feel free to take the compliment. However, ignore negative remarks, and recognize that compliments your personality are more significant. Care more about what you think of yourself instead of what others think of you. Focus on your own uplifting, positive thoughts about yourself instead of on others opinions about you. At the end of the day, you are the only person who has to live with himself or herself, so your opinion should matter the most.  People who insult others usually do it to make themselves feel more powerful. This means that they are probably just as insecure as you are. They are the ones who lack confidence, so try to avoid the comments and avoid jabbing back with an insult. The best thing you can do is to live your life exactly how you want to live it without looking back. This may be easier said than done. Instead of being in denial about caring, ask yourself what is at the heart of wanting to please other people. Ask yourself if the people who hurt you are worth impressing. Soon enough, you'll see that they are only an obstacle to your happiness, not a means toward it.  Know whom to trust, and when.

Or, go for a ten-minute run to activate your muscles and break a sweat. It's important to stretch your muscles after your five to ten minute cardio warm up so you do not injure yourself while doing high-intensity exercises. You should also stretch for five to ten minutes at the end of your workout. Stretching will keep you from pulling your muscles or harming your body. Do basic leg and arm stretches so your bigger muscles are warmed up and ready to work during your exercise routine.

This type of exercise will help you burn fat fast. High-intensity exercises force your body to use the sugars in your body and allows you to burn fat faster than low-intensity workouts. You will also use stored body fat during the recovery phase, which will reduce your stored body fat. You can perform HIIT exercises with gym equipment, or an exercise mat and a few free weights. There are several popular HIIT programs, including:  The Beach Body Workout: This twelve-week HIIT program only takes 21 minutes, three days a week, and is designed to help strengthen and sculpt your body, while also shedding weight. The program targets specific areas of your body, such as your arms and abs, and integrates cardio and stretching.

This type of HIIT program combines continuous training with speed intervals. You control the intensity and speed of each interval, so the training can feel spontaneous and engaging. This program focuses on cardio training, where you walk, jog, or sprint for set amounts of time. The Countdown Jump Rope Workout: To do this interval workout, all you need is a stopwatch and a jump rope. Start by trying to jump for two straight minutes, then rest for two minutes, and jump rope again for 1.5 minutes. Then, rest for one and a half minutes and then jump rope again for one minute, and rest for one minute. Finish with jumping rope for 30 seconds. Rest for three minutes and then repeat the intervals one to two more times. Playing sports is a great way to burn calories while having fun. Sports puts a little competitive fire into the equation; you often forget that you're working out, and will still likely break a sweat.

Swimming: An hour of swimming in the pool will burn 400-600 calories, and strengthen your joints, your muscles, and improve your blood circulation.  Basketball: Playing a game of full-court basketball can help you burn 400 to 700 calories. Mix up your workout week by joining a fitness class that combines cardio with strength building and interval training.  An aerobics and dance class like Zumba can help you lose weight.

Shoot for a decent length of time, like 3-4 weeks. This lack of contact may get your ex to think about what you are doing. Have you moved on? Are you dating other people? Are you over the break up already?  If your ex texts or calls you, don't respond. If your ex tries to contact you on social media, don't reply. Don't text or call him, especially to talk about the relationship. Get some distance. You want to make it look like you're moving on and not letting the breakup bother you. The key is to make your ex think about you and start wondering what you are doing because he doesn't know what you are doing, who you are seeing, or where you are going. Resist the temptation to text with your ex late at night. Late night melancholia may make you do things you'll regret in the morning. Don't give in if your ex texts for a booty call. Be strong and ignore those messages.  After the period of silence, respond back with simple comments. Say something like, \"hey,\" or respond to their text with something short and witty. Keep it light and casual. When you break up, don't stop hanging out with the friends that you and your ex have in common. Instead, go hang out with your friends when invited somewhere, or go to the normal dinner in the city both of you used to attend together.  Staying friends helps you remember that these people were your friends, too. There's no point in losing good friends just because you broke up. Going out with mutual friends also helps information get back to your ex. This is a good way to show that you are doing great and not moping around. A good way to get under your ex's skin is to post pictures of yourself with the opposite sex. It doesn't matter if it's a colleague, a friend, or someone's sibling. Interacting and letting your ex see you with someone else helps show that you are moving on. It also shows that he is being replaced, which helps trigger jealousy.  Decide which social media outlet your ex would be more likely to see. Then, post a few good pictures with someone. Don't overdo it. Don't post pictures with ten different people, and don't post tons of pictures. You want to tease your ex with the idea that you are with someone else. Don't be obvious that you are trying to make him jealous. You don't want to seem desperate. Hanging out and being friends with the opposite sex can also cause your ex to be jealous. Flirt, meet, and have fun with the opposite sex. Try to do it so that your ex finds out about it. This could be accomplished by posting about it through social media, or flirting with the opposite sex when mutual friends are around. Date other people with caution. If the ultimate goal is to get your ex back, then dating someone else can push him away. You don't want to sabotage your chances of getting back together if that is what you want. When you see your ex, act nice. By talking to him, smiling, and asking how he is doing, you show that you are moving on and getting over it. This can help make him jealous. He may even think about how nice and great you are afterwards.  Keep the conversation light and natural. Treat your ex like an acquaintance. Ask surface questions, not questions about who your ex is dating. If asked how you are doing, say you are doing well. Make sure not to oversell it. You don't want your ex to think you are faking.  Don't be rude to him. That is a classic way of showing you are not over the breakup. If you say something mean to him, it could turn him off and make him glad you two broke up. Don't show your ex that you are interested in him at all. When he posts updates about life events, like a promotion or a trip, don't engage. Don't like the post, don't comment, and don't mention it to your friends. Make it so your ex thinks you are totally off his radar. If someone brings up something about your ex later, claim that you didn't know, even if you did. Make sure it's clear to your ex (even through the grapevine) that you are not interested in his life and are not keeping up with him. One key way to make your ex jealous is to not let on that you are upset. Even if you are heartbroken, pretend that you are good. Don't talk about the breakup, and don't let your ex see that you're sad. Make your ex think that you don't care that the relationship has ended.  Don't talk about the breakup on social media. Don't update your status or tweet about how you are sad, refrain from posting sad lyrics, and make sure you don't make cryptic posts. Your ex may see this and think you are talking about the relationship. Try not to be too chipper. There's a line between being okay and over it and being fake happy.

Some people with kidney disease can have one drink on occasion. However, you should talk to your doctor to get precise recommendations about how much alcohol is safe for you.  If your doctor says it is okay to drink, then make sure you do not exceed one drink per day and count it as part of your fluid intake for the day. Ask that friends and family members do not drink around you at social events. If you know a social event will involve drinking, try sitting that event out or asking a friend or family member to refrain from drinking with you. If you struggle to give up alcohol, talk to a therapist about how to quit drinking. You can also seek out the support of groups like Alcoholics Anonymous if you believe you have a drinking problem. You may not have to limit your fluid intake early on, but many people have to cut down on fluid consumption in the later stages of kidney disease. If you are on dialysis, fluid can build up in the body between sessions. Your doctor may want you to stick within a certain range of fluids throughout the day. Look into ways to manage your thirst without drinking too much liquid.  Drink from smaller glasses during meals. If you're at a restaurant, turn your cup over when you're done drinking. This will let your server know not to refill your cup, allowing you to avoid the temptation of drinking too much water. You can try freezing fruit juices in ice trays. You can suck on these juices like popsicles, allowing you to alleviate your thirst slowly. Just make sure to count these popsicles towards your total fluid intake for the day. If you need to limit your fluids, try using a pitcher to track the amount of fluid you are allowed to drink per day. Fill the pitcher with water and only drink from the pitcher throughout the day. If you have something else that counts as a fluid, such as coffee, milk, jello, or ice cream, then pour out the amount of water equal to what you consumed. Make sure to count fluids from canned fruit, canned vegetables, soups, and any other sources as well. Sodas should generally be avoided, as they're a source of unnecessary calories and sugar. However, if you like soda on occasion, go for light colored varieties. Lemon flavored sodas, like Sprite, are better than darker sodas like Coke and Pepsi. Make sure that you avoid colas and soft drinks that contain phosphate or phosphoric acid. Sodas also have high amounts of sodium in them, and it is important to decrease your sodium/salt intake.

A photo editor will allow you to produce a more precise design by lining up text, giving you the freedom to choose fonts and adding professional borders. You can even import pictures to use as part of the design.  Word processors make it easy to format text the way you want it and add pictures to go with it, while one advantage of photo editing programs is that they give you greater control over how to alter pictures and let you drag, layer and angle bits of text for better customization.

Don\u2019t use photos that are graphic or offensive. Remember, your notebook is part of your scholastic materials. Instead of just using the text bar to type your name and class information, make use of the word processor's text capabilities, like choosing different fonts and colors, as part of your design. Spell out a couple of lines of song lyrics, or maybe highlight a favorite quotation to keep you motivated to study. Typed text doesn't have to be boring. Play around with text features and see if you can come up with fun new ways to add a few words to your cover.

The first step to the process is identifying the individual.  Make sure you have the correct spelling of the person's first, middle, and last time. Small spelling errors can make a big difference when seeking out information.  Try to find a date of birth, or at least a range of time in which the person was likely born. This makes finding certain documents easier down the road. If you're writing an article about an individual, you do not want to rehash information that's already out there. Search online and through newspapers, magazines, and tabloids for existing stories about the individual. Not only does this prevent you from publishing a redundant piece, it adds to the array of information you have on the individual. Use public records to your advantage to build your profile. Using a variety of outlets, scan public records for important information.  Local records are a good start, even if the individual isn't originally from your location. Go to city hall, the county clerk's office, and any local branch of state and federal offices. Look through permits, power of attorney, liens, building permits, deeds, licenses, driving records, and anything else that turns up.  Look through court records. Any history of court appearances can be found online, but you might have to go to the court house to actually view the records.  Check with local police and sheriff's offices for any past criminal activity. Also check local, state, and county jail records. Some information may be hard to find, depending on your state's open record laws. You should look into the individual's employment history to check for any surprises or inconsistencies.  Make direct phone calls to past and current employers. Ask for employment verification and if they ask why you're calling, simply tell them the truth. Usually, whoever you're speaking to will comply.  You can see if you can get a copy of the individual's resume through past and current employers. Oftentimes, the person you're investigating will be in a professional field that requires a license. He might be a dentist or a psychiatrist, for example. Try to verify that license to check for fraud. Also, investigate every claim on his resume, such as where he went to school, grants and awards he claims to have received, and any certificates he lists.

You want to make sure your party guests stay satiated. Appetizers like meatballs, pigs in a blanket, bean dip, or chicken wings are a good idea to serve. You can make the finger food fun by serving it in a unique way. For example, serve cupcakes in plastic martini glasses or use mini pretzel sticks instead of toothpicks for appetizers. If you don\u2019t want to worry about the food so you can enjoy your own party, you can hire a caterer to prepare and serve the food. Although this is a costly option, it will allow you to be able to join in the fun more. Another great idea is to hire a bartender to mix and serve your drinks.

If you see him pretty regularly at the bus stop, for example, your approach will be different than if you see him somewhere less public and quieter, such as the school library. Because we\u2019re human, we put a lot of stock, knowingly or not, in body language (kinesics).  Guys notice smiles, and you\u2019ve got one to share.  A smile tells him a few things about you before he ever talks with you:  it tells him that you\u2019re not a snob or aloof, that you are enjoying your day, and that you\u2019re a positive person.  We are naturally attracted to happy people, so next time you see him, even if you don\u2019t approach him, make sure to smile. If you\u2019re not quite comfortable walking up to this guy and talking to him yet, you can still get his attention by making eye contact.  Or, if you catch him looking at you, hold his gaze briefly.  Whether you initiate the eye contact or he does, hold the gaze for a second or two and then look away.  You don\u2019t want to run the risk of appearing creepy by maintaining eye contact for a long time \u2013 just long enough to let him know that you see him. This is another great opportunity to smile a little at him. When you\u2019re ready, walk up and simply ask the guy a question.  It shows him that you\u2019re interested in his answer, and once you\u2019ve broken the ice, the way is clear to keep up the conversation.  \u201cHi, I see that you have the wireless version of those headphones and I\u2019m having trouble deciding between the wireless or studio version.

Search for nonprofit organizations dedicated to assisting people who are blind. Schools for the blind also have resources available to the general public.  The Hadley Institute for the Visually Impaired offers distance-learning courses for reading Braille. These courses are free for the visually impaired. Visit https://hadley.edu/brailleCoursesFAQ.asp to evaluate available courses. You can also purchase Braille blocks and toys online to help with learning letters. These materials can be especially helpful for young children. A standard Braille cell is made up of 6 dots arranged in 2 columns of 3 dots each. All of the dots are equal distance apart. The top left dot is numbered \"1,\" the dot below it is \"2,\" and the bottom dot in the first column is \"3.\" The dots in the second column are numbered \"4,\" \"5,\" and \"6\" from top to bottom. Each Braille letter or symbol has a unique combination of dots and blank spaces.  Braille printed for the sighted may have \"shadow dots\" in the empty spaces, to help people see the positions of the dots more easily. Braille for the blind won't have shadow dots. To read Braille through touch, you need reasonably good finger sensitivity. Most adults have enough finger sensitivity to read Braille. If your finger sensitivity has been impacted by an injury or health condition, you may want to use \"jumbo dot\" Braille. In the Braille code, the first 10 letters of the alphabet form the basis of all the other letters. These letters only use the top 4 dots in each cell. Thinking about the numbering of the dots in relation to the letter's place in the alphabet may help you learn them easier.  The letter a has dot 1 only. This makes intuitive sense because a is the first letter of the alphabet. Likewise, the letter b has dot 1 and dot 2, for the second letter of the alphabet. The letter c has dot 1 and dot 4. The letter d has dots 1, 4, and 5. The letter e has dots 1 and 5. The letter f has dots 1, 2, and 4. The letter g has dots 1, 2, 4, and 5 \u2013 all 4 top dots are full. the letter h has dots 1, 2, and 5. You can think of g as adding dot 3 to letter f, and then h as taking away dot 4 from letter g. Unlike the previous 8 letters, the letters i and j do not have dot 1. The letter i has dots 2 and 4. The letter j has dots 2, 4, and 5. The Braille code follows a distinct pattern. The next 10 letters of the alphabet are formed by repeating the same dots as the first 10 letters, then adding dot 3 to each to form the new letter. For example, the letter k has 2 dots: the dot 1 from the letter a plus dot 3. Note that the letter l, with dots 1, 2, and 3, basically looks like the lower-case letter it represents. For the remaining letters (except w), take the k through o and add dot 6. Leave the letter w out completely, as it doesn't fit the pattern all the other letters do.  The letter u has dot 1 and 3 from letter k, plus dot 6. The letter v has dots 1, 2, and 3 from letter l, plus dot 6. Since you're skipping w for now, the next letter is x, which has dots 1, 3, and 4 from letter m, plus dot 6. The letter y has dots 1, 3, 4, and 5 from letter n, plus dot 6. The letter z has dots 1, 3, and 5 from letter o, plus dot 6. The letter w is the only letter that doesn't fit the pattern. This is because the Braille code was invented by Frenchman Louis Braille in 1860. At the time, there was no w in the French alphabet, so Braille didn't include it in his code.

Carnitas is the Mexican name for slow-braised pork \u2014 specifically, Boston butt or picnic ham cuts. The meat is first slow-braised to break down the collagens and cook the meat, and then finished off fried or saut\u00e9ed to develop a crispy texture. \"Al pastor\" means \"in the style of the shepherd,\" and it probably originated as a Mexican interpretation of Lebanese shawarma. Today, it is a spicy way to cook pork, and it's absolutely delicious. Try this meat out in a burrito. Do it! Chorizo is a spicy pork sausage that comes in a casing. When saut\u00e9ed, it is deeply aromatic and flavorful. Common in breakfast burritos but also in normal burritos.

Lack of empathy; they don't seem to care when someone else is hurt. Propensity to lie; they do it casually, like it's nothing. Incapacity for love; those closest to them realize something is missing. Egocentricity; they light up when they're the center of attention. Delusions of grandeur; they often perceive themselves as superior to others. Sociopaths aren't driven by the desire to make the world a better place, help others or be accountable in their closest relationships. \"Doing the right thing\" is not a motivator for a sociopath; rather, sociopaths are motivated by having power over other people and using it to get what they want: more power, money, casual sex and so on.  Even if a sociopath takes an action that appears to be good-hearted or kind, there's usually an ulterior motive. Sociopaths often cheat on their partners, since they don't feel guilt for doing so. They're dangerous because they're capable of making people do whatever they want. Sociopaths use a variety of strategies to cause people in their lives to do things for them. They often pit people against each other to achieve their own ends, or have others lie for them to cover up the truth.  Sociopaths are often at the center of love triangles, or the people to break up a marriage. In a workplace setting, they might undermine coworkers to make themselves look good in front of the boss. In a friend circle, a sociopath might cause drama that forces people to take sides, while they coolly control the entire situation. A sociopath does not care who gets used or hurt, because sociopaths have no conscience or scruples against taking gross advantage of your kindness and goodwill. A key characteristic of a sociopath is that they can not comprehend that others have feelings or can be hurt by their actions.  Sociopaths don't change to become empathetic. No amount of \"talking it through\" or giving the person extra chances is going to make them a better person. If you can distance yourself enough to realize it's not really about you, you'll have more power to stand up to the sociopath.

You can often find fangs and fake blood as a set at a costume shop or in the Halloween section of a big box store like Walmart.  You can also make your own vampire fangs if you are really trying to do-it-yourself. You can make vampire fangs by using fake nails, a straw, acrylic gel, or a plastic fork. Most vampire fangs in stores will come with a way to keep the fangs in your mouth or attached to your top teeth, such as teeth glue or a mould that fits over your teeth. Make sure the vampire fangs include an adhesive of some kind in the package. You can make your own fake blood as well out of basic household supplies if you are really looking to DIY your costume. You can even do this step if you have braces. It will take a bit more work, seeing as you have to make your own that will work with braces. You can use orthodontic wax if you have any, or use denture glue for a more longer-last look. To really get the vampire look, you will need to make your skin appear very pale. You can do this by using a foundation that is one to two shades paler than your normal foundation or by using pale face paint. The hue of the foundation will depend on your skin tone. If you already have a pale skin tone, you may not need to use that much foundation on your skin. If you have a darker skin tone, you will likely need to use a very pale foundation to make your skin appear lighter. The amount of makeup you use on the rest of your face, such as your eyes and mouth, will depend on the vampire look you are going for. If you are going for a more glam vampire look, you may decide to also apply dramatic eye makeup and lipstick. But if you are pressed for time and are trying to go for a more scary vampire look, you may decide to keep your makeup simple and minimal.

Head movements, watching TV for prolonged periods, reading books, focusing on an object for a long time, crowds, darkness and walking often aggravate dizziness. It is due to bizarre signals from the vestibular system of both ears. The semicircular tubes of vestibule are filled with special type of fluid. Movement of this fluid stimulates nerve tissue within the tubes which provokes a sense of position and balance. Labyrinthitis alters the normal composition of this fluid, leading to abnormal signal production which is interpreted as dizziness. Dizziness or lightheadedness may be experienced in many other conditions. In anemia, low blood pressure, low blood glucose (hypoglycemia), blood loss or dehydration the prominent symptom will be weakness. You may also faint sometimes. You may feel that your head is spinning or the world is spinning around you. This is also a symptom of vestibular system inflammation. Head injury, M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, stroke, etc. may also cause vertigo but they will have specific patterns and other associated symptoms (which will be discussed later). Severity of vertigo varies considerably. You may feel mild dizziness and out of balance or the attack may be so severe that you cannot remain upright anymore. It may also be associated with nausea and vomiting. Vertigo in labyrinthitis is most severe in the first week. Thereafter it starts to get better as you learn to cope with the symptoms. You may hear constant ringing, buzzing, whistling or humming sounds in the affected ear. It is due to involvement of the cochlea or hearing apparatus. In tinnitus, there is a formation of abnormal particles in the fluid of the internal area that stimulate hair cells (nerve endings that carry sound signal). This unusual stimulation is interpreted as tinnitus. Conditions that cause vertigo may also cause tinnitus. Additionally, exposure to noisy environment may cause tinnitus. In that case you will usually have no other symptoms. It occurs when the cochlear nerve is damaged or blocked by inflammation. You may experience reduced or total loss of hearing. This is a more severe symptom of labyrinthitis that warrants urgent medical attention because the hearing loss may be permanent. If hearing loss is accompanied by tinnitus, check your external ear for impacted wax. You will fully regain hearing function after removing the wax. Discharge of pus or watery fluid indicate bacterial infection of the middle ear (otitis media) that has perforated the tympanic membrane (a partition between external ear and middle ear). You should visit your doctor promptly to control the infection because it may permanently impair your hearing. Think about if your ears feel heavy. If there is accumulation of pus or fluid in the middle ear, you may feel a heaviness or pressure in the affected ear. It is common in bacterial infections. These are actually symptoms of the symptoms. Here's how it works:  Pain in the ear is also a sign of an infective condition. It may be accompanied by tinnitus. The vertigo or dizziness that accompanies labyrinthitis may lead to nausea and vomiting. A fever that is above 38\u00b0C (100\u00b0F) is an indication that you have an infection in your body. Blurred vision may be the result of a pinched nerve. It may be difficult to read and see things at a distance. A few conditions mimic labyrinthitis. In order to treat yourself effectively, it's important to be sure that you have this infection and not something similar. Here are some conditions that mimic labyrinthitis:   M\u00e9ni\u00e8res syndrome. It is caused by unusual accumulation of fluid in the inner ear. A typical attack starts with a feeling of fullness in the ear, increasing tinnitus and decreasing hearing followed by severe vertigo, often accompanied by nausea and vomiting. An attack usually lasts 20-30 minutes.  Migraines. It is not exactly a problem of the ear. Migraine occurs due to constriction followed by dilatation of blood vessels of the brain. One sided headache is most prominent symptom.  Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. It occurs due to displacement of crystals from utricle and saccule into semicircular canals. The displaced particles inappropriately stimulate semicircular canals leading to vertigo and dizziness.  Transient ischemic attack (TIA) or mini stroke. If there is vascular insufficiency in hearing or balance related areas of the brain, you may experience dizziness, loss of balance or loss of hearing temporarily.  You should feel better in a few minutes and the symptom will not recur.  Brain tumor. Usually you will experience very specific set of symptoms. It will depend on the location of the tumor. However, headache and convulsion are common with any brain tumor. There may be weakness in a specific site of the body. Symptoms may last about 1 to 3 weeks. Even though it may be short, it is still best to call your doctor when experiencing these symptoms to avoid a serious complication of permanent hearing loss.

One way to do this is through asking questions. Some common things to ponder include, \u201cWho am I? Why am I here? What is my purpose?\u201d While these questions can make you feel anxious or fearful, they also can open the door to creating meaning in your life. Instead of immediately reacting to fear, take a step back and acknowledge your own inner process. Consider changing your relationship to fear: ask, \u201cwhere does this fear come from and how did it originate?\u201d  Approach your fear in curiosity. For instance, if you\u2019re experiencing the fear of death, be curious about this fear. Don\u2019t get distracted by the negative feelings or gloomy thoughts. Instead, notice the fear and get curious about it. What can you learn about yourself by exploring this fear? Sometimes existential fears can connect with other types of fears or things that are happening in your life. By examining your fears, you may be able to live a more purposeful life and decide if making a significant life change is something that you need to do to work towards that goal.  For example, fears about dying or no longer existing might be connected to a sense that you lack control in your own life. You might feel like you lack control due to an unhealthy relationship or a boring job. By identifying what is making you feel like you lack control, you can make changes to help you feel like you are in control again, such as seeking marriage counseling or looking for a different job. Fear can make you feel helpless or \u201cstuck.\u201d When faced with absolute freedom, you may feel overwhelmed. Yet, if you experience limited freedom, you may feel trapped and despairing. Recognize that you have the freedom to make choices and that you are, in fact, free. When recognizing your freedom, it\u2019s important to accept that freedom comes with inherent responsibility, meaning that when you make a choice, you are responsible for handling the outcome of that choice. You may feel \u201cstuck\u201d in a job, a city, a marriage, or particular life situation. Remind yourself that you can experience freedom at all stages of life. Yet, as you experience freedom, also recognize the outcomes of your choices and respond to them responsibly. You may feel defeated or come to the conclusion that nothing really matters. There are many ways to approach existential fears. You can feel overwhelmed by the fears, or you can choose to see them from a different angle. For example, when confronting existential fear, recognize that if you have the capacity to experience fear and anxiety, you also have the capacity to experience the opposite of fear and anxiety, such as calm and safety. Stay hopeful as you work through your fears.  Acknowledge your strengths and recognize that even if you feel hopeless in a situation, you do have strengths and positive traits to contribute.

To avoid getting caught, try to make sure that your secret destination isn't more than 15 or so minutes away from where you're supposed to be. It would be very stressful to get stranded somewhere hours away and then have to explain to your parents why you were there. If you and your parents have an app like Find my Friends, your parents will be able to see where you are. Be sure that, if you and your parents have this app, you disable your location settings before going on a secret mission. If you are in a place with noise that will give away your whereabouts, let your parents\u2019 call go to voicemail. Then, immediately text them and explain why you couldn\u2019t answer. That way, they won\u2019t worry because they are hearing from you, and you won\u2019t have to lie directly about where you are.

If your parents know this trick or get suspicious when you don\u2019t answer calls, try to duck into a bathroom or quiet hallway to answer the call. If you call your parents to tell them you are, for example, back at your friend\u2019s house getting ready for bed, make sure that you are inside when you call them. If you are standing on a street or driving in a car, the background noise could give you away. You don\u2019t have to be at the friend\u2019s house who you claim to be with, but just be sure you are inside somewhere quiet.

You do not want to say things that sound like you're blaming the person. This will only increase negative feelings and make your loved one less likely to seek help.

The seder plate plays a central role in the Passover celebration. It consists of six symbolic foods, plus three pieces of matzah which will be placed on a separate plate. The six symbolic foods are:  The Bitter Herbs. Traditionally this would be horseradish, but parsley, green onion, or celery can also be used. The Paste or Charoset. This is a sweet mixture which represents the mortar used by the slaves to build the pyramids of Egypt. It is usually a ground mixture of apples, nuts and wine. A variety of recipes can be found online. The Vegetable. This is a non-bitter, root vegetable such as a boiled potato. This represents the hard labor of the slaves. The Shankbone. This is a shankbone, usually lamb or goat, which symbolizes the sacrificial lamb of Passover. The Egg. A hard-boiled egg used to symbolize the offering made in the days of the Temple. The Lettuce. This is usually romaine, which like the bitter herbs symbolizes the bitterness of slavery. This is a book which will contain the necessary prayers, as well as the procedures and story of Passover for the seder. It is a useful guide for how to perform the seder properly.  You can find a copy of the Haggadah in English online. You can also listen to a recitation of \u201cThe Order of the Seder\u201d online. This is a blessing said over wine in honor of Passover.

The vegetable is a symbol of the humble origins of the Jewish people. The salt water is a symbol of the tears shed due to slavery. Break the middle of the three matzah on the table, known as \"yachatz\". Return the smaller part to the pile. The larger part will be returned to the pile for the afikoman. Tell the story of Passover, which is the story of the Exodus of the Jews from Egypt. Have the youngest child ask the traditional four questions, and drink the second cup of wine. The traditional four questions are:  \"What has changed, this night, from all the other nights? That in all other nights we eat both chametz and matzah, on this night, we eat only matzah?\" \"What has changed, this night, from all the other nights? That in all other nights we eat many vegetables, on this night, maror?\" \"What has changed, this night, from all the other nights?

On all other nights, we eat either sitting or reclining, either sitting or reclining.

Your mind is not focused on the past or present, but on the here and now. Being mindful also means acknowledging your thoughts, feelings, and present situation without judgment.  Don\u2019t: Earlier today, someone budged in front of you in line at the grocery store. You thought about saying something, but decided against it. Now you can\u2019t stop thinking about how angry you felt at that moment; you practise over and over again in your mind the things you wish you had said to that person. Do: Whenever the angry memory of that person budging in front of you pops into your head, acknowledge it but then let it go. Think, \u201cyes, I felt angry then, but I don\u2019t have to waste time feeling angry now,\u201d and then return your awareness to the present moment. In a sense, being mindful means getting out of your head (and into the moment)! This is connected to being mindful. Practise making a mental photograph of your surroundings. Really pay attention to the things around you \u2014 the colours, the smells, the people, the weather.  Live in the moment. Studies have shown that your brain cannot efficiently switch between tasks, meaning that when you multitask, you actually lose time. Research has also shown that we are less likely to retain what we learn when we\u2019re multitasking. In short, if you want to remember something, don\u2019t do it while multitasking! Learn a language, play an instrument, increase your vocabulary \u2014 learning new things will keep your brain on its toes, so to speak. When we do the same things every day, our brain doesn\u2019t receive the stimulation it needs to grow, so be sure to introduce new things regularly. You might also try learning different ways of using your senses \u2014 for example, brushing your teeth with your non-dominant hand (if you\u2019re right-handed, use your left) or turning a book upside down and reading it that way for 10 minutes. Studies show that using multiple senses helps us better understand and remember new concepts. If you want to remember something, visualize it, write it down, and say it out loud.  If you are trying to remember someone\u2019s name, visualize them with their name written on their head. As you do this, say their name out loud. If you are trying to memorize a language, pick 10 to 20 words to remember each day, and write each of them out 10 times while saying them out loud. You might even do this a few times until you can write and say each word perfectly, without having to think about it. Flash cards are a good example of how you can enlist visualization, writing, and speaking to create memories; they are a wonderful tool for studying. If you want to help a memory stick in your brain, say it out loud as you complete the activity associated with it. When you meet someone new, say their name as you shake their hand (\u201cHi Sam\u201d), then say it again when you finish the conversation (\u201cIt was nice meeting you, Sam\u201d) or, if that feels weird, you can say it quietly to yourself as you walk away. On the way out the door in the morning, you remember that when you get home you need to do laundry. Instead of writing yourself a note or starting laundry before you go, you can do something like leave a shoe out in your hallway (if your hallway is usually empty/tidy, that is). Simply seeing that shoe out of place should spark the memory of wanting to do laundry. Your brain can only process so much information at a time; reduce what you want to learn into bite-sized chunks, so to speak. To ensure that you use your memory as effectively as possible, prioritize what you want to memorize, and start with the most important information.  It\u2019s important to give yourself the time and space to properly remember things. We often need time just to process information before we can properly use it.  Instead of remembering the number, 5-6-2-2-8-9-7, make it 562-28-97. Throughout the day, give yourself little tests \u2014 for example, when you leave a restaurant, ask yourself to describe what your server looked like: his/her hair, eyes, shirt colour, name (if there was a name tag).

Chance meetings with sharks that are on the hunt for other food or simply swimming from point A to point B are perfectly possible. Don't react tensely or frantically to the sight of a shark unless you have to \u2014 as mentioned above, making wild movements and large splashes can attract its attention and make it think that you are a wounded animal.  Instead, stay calm and focus on your immediate goal: getting out of the water quickly, quietly, and smoothly. Resist your natural instinct to make a mad dash to safety unless the shark is aggressively following you. If you are fishing in a small boat when you notice a shark, let any fish on the line go and move away. If you are diving at significant depths, surfacing quickly can be dangerous and should be used as a last resort. Instead, release any fish or bait you have with you and move laterally away from the shark. Exit the water at a reasonable pace once you are away from it. As you make your exit from the water, try to keep an eye on the shark if possible. Watch its body language \u2014 aggressive sharks tend to act noticeably different from non-aggressive ones. If you see the following signs, move more quickly as you try to get out of the water and get ready to defend yourself if necessary. Movements that indicate a shark might be ready to attack include:  Making quick, sharp turns while swimming. \"Hunching\" or arching the back. Circling, especially if the circles get tighter Charging Lowering the dorsal fin (the one on the back) Rubbing the belly against the sea floor Showing other sudden or erratic movements. In the very unlikely event that you are attacked by a shark, you will almost always fare better if the shark is not able to take you by surprise. If you see the signs of aggression listed above, keep your eyes on the shark and make an effort to use even, steady movements as you continue making an exit from the water. If you have anything you can use to defend yourself, grab hold of it. If you can, put your back to a reef, wall or another object to limit the shark's angles of attack. Most importantly, get ready to fight back. If you are near other people, it's also crucial to call out to them for several reasons. Not only will this notify them of the danger and give them a chance to themselves \u2014 it can also help you. Statistically, there are few cases of rescuers being attacked when helping someone else get away from a shark. It's thought that suddenly encountering a second person in the water can spook a shark enough to make it run away. Playing dead once a shark makes a decision to attack will do you no favors. This can make the shark think that you're defeated, which is what it wants, and may encourage more bites. On the other hand, if you make yourself appear strong and dangerous, the shark may go off to find easier prey. Remember: sharks aren't usually used to prey that puts up a serious fight \u2014 the majority would be much happier chasing an easy fish than a human who's willing to punch, kick, and gouge.  Try to strike the shark's eyes and gills with whatever you have. These areas are the most vulnerable, pain-sensitive parts of a shark. Punch and claw at them repeatedly until the shark lets you go. Contrary to popular myth, the nose is not as good of target as the eyes and gills. It's less sensitive to pain and is also right next to the mouth, which is the last thing you want to stick your hand into. If you're diving, use any tools you have, like a diving knife or even a spare tank to hit the shark.  Don\u2019t stop fighting. The goal is to convince the shark that attacking you is more trouble than it is worth. Giving up will just make the shark's job easier. As soon as you can after a shark attack, get out of the water and stay out, even if you don't think you have any injuries. The adrenaline pumping through your body may make it difficult to judge how hurt you are at first. Getting out of the water (and staying out) doesn't just keep you out of the shark's reach, but also gives you a chance to determine what to do next with a reasonably level head.  Get medical attention for any injuries immediately, even if they don't seem serious. This is extra important if you are bleeding \u2014 since it is more difficult for your body to stop bleeding underwater, you may already have lost a significant amount of blood.  Don't get back in the water even if the shark seems to have left and you have no injuries. The only reason to get back in the water (provided you are uninjured) is to save them from a shark attack \u2014 as mentioned above, some sharks may flee when dealing with a group of people, rather than just one. This advice should go without saying. Almost any animal that is taunted, harassed, or chased will eventually defend itself. Sharks are no exception, though their deadly predatory capabilities make the consequences for mistakes much higher than with most animals. If you do see a shark, exit the water and leave it alone.

Hopefully, this will suck up any eggs or crickets that might be hiding. If you have a bagless vacuum cleaner, be sure to empty the contents of the container in a trash can outside your home. If you have a vacuum cleaner with a bag, replace the bag immediately after you finish. Throw away the used bag in a trash can outdoors and away from your home. If you have some pepper spray on hand, then you can quickly kill the cricket by using some of it on the cricket. Pepper spray is deadly to crickets. Be careful when using pepper spray. It will be painful for you if you get it near your face. Be sure to wash your hands thoroughly after using the spray. If you\u2019ve only got one cricket in your home, you can catch it easily with a jar. When you find the cricket, place a glass jar quickly over the top of the cricket so that it is trapped inside. Take a thin (but strong) piece of cardboard (a postcard works well, for example) and slide it underneath the opening of the jar. Now you will have a piece of card that you can keep on the top of the jar while you take it outside. Take the cricket far away from your house.

An easy way to start the raw vegan diet is to eat what you are familiar with: salads, smoothies, salsas, guacamole, and fresh raw vegetables and fruit. . Smoothies are one of the best ways to eat raw. Throw in all sorts of fruits and vegetables. Smoothies make good breakfasts and snacks. Juicing is another popular way to eat with a raw diet. After you invest in a juicer, you can juice almost all fruits and vegetables. Popular things to juice are celery, carrots, and greens like spinach and kale. You can also juice most fruits, which adds nice flavor to your juice. To get the most out of your raw vegan diet, make sure to buy organic. This ensures you are not getting any harmful toxins from your raw foods. This can be expensive, so you may need to start small at first. One of the major staples of a raw vegan diet are leafy greens. You can use leafy greens for salads, in smoothies, or when juicing. Leafy greens include kale, spinach, Swiss chard, collard greens, beet greens, arugula, and lettuce. When you eat grains as a raw vegan, make sure to soak and sprout the grains. Grains you can use for this diet are amaranth, millet, barley, buckwheat, kamut, oats, wheat berries, and wild rice. You should also limit the amount of sprouted grains you eat since they contain irritants. You can steam grains, just make sure to keep it at a low temperature. Make sure the grains you eat are gluten free.  Some people believe you shouldn't eat grains at all on a raw vegan diet. You can also sprout some legumes. However, some people believe that larger beans, like soybeans, are not healthy. By sprouting them, you can eliminate what some believe are toxins, but they don't taste the best. Generally, people on a raw vegan diet don't eat legumes.  Sprouts, such as radish, clover, and broccoli, are safe raw. Healthy oils are important to a raw vegan diet. They are a great source of healthy fat. You can use them for salad dressings, desserts, dips, and toppings. Try using coconut oil, flax seed oil, hemp seed oil, walnut oil, olive oil, and avocado oil. Nuts and seeds are great additions to your raw vegan diet. You can use them on top of salads, as snacks, in desserts, to make crackers, and in many other things. Try almonds, walnuts, macadamia nuts, sunflower seeds, hemp seeds, chia seeds, and pumpkin seeds, among numerous others. Fish are not the only source of omega-3 fats.

Remind yourself that even if you are preoccupied with yourself, maybe even sick of thinking about yourself, people in your life experience the opposite. As a shy person, people you care about may be wishing that they know or understand you better. By making attempts to let some of this inner-world out, you are also opening yourself up to other perspectives. If your self-image is quite negative, chances are good that opening up to those you trust will only help you see great parts of you that you fail to consider. When you want to open up to friends, family, or a romantic partner, don't be afraid to be frank about where you're coming from. By letting your guard down and talking about how you presently feel, others will feel instantly connected to a deeper part of you. Most importantly, the other person will not recoil in doubt or fear that something wrong with him makes it difficult for you to open up.  Try starting with something like \"I want you to know that I'm a little shy talking about this, so please bear with me.\" This statement enlists support rather than making an excuse. Remember that you do not need to apologize for your level of progress in opening up. Apologizing will set off doubt and passivity. Make sure that you are not owning your shyness to signal that you need sympathy or babying. The purpose is to give insight into why you might seem nervous or aloof. Having patience and support from others should ultimately help you take risks and display effort as you learn how to be more comfortable opening up. Turn your focus outward and let the other person motivate your desire to open up. Watch facial expressions and listen for raises in tone that cue you in to what the person is getting excited about. Excitement is contagious, and with deep engagement it'll be hard not to return it.  Deep attention to the cues of others does not mean that you should take a subordinate position in conversation. For instance, if your brother is detailing a problem that he's having at work, you could respond either by asking for more information, giving comforting advice and input, or sharing a similar experience. Shyness is, in part, an excessive self-focus, which makes it difficult to respond appropriately to others. Focusing on others more generally is an exercise that will lift you further and further out of extreme shyness. Begin to trust in the fact that having someone's attention in an intimate setting is happening in the first place because they already hope to hear more from you. Ease into openness by reminding yourself that there is no right and wrong to your feelings. If you feel judged or fear judgment, ask yourself \"who is judging me here?\" Opening up to others can be how you get away from your harshest critic--yourself.  There is always something to share from the heart. Do you feel blank, empty, or at a loss? Those are some pretty intimate things to let someone know. You may even unleash a whole stream of feelings and memories surrounding that very fact. You might begin by saying \"You know, it's funny, whenever I go to talk about myself, I come up with a big blank space.

It may be easier for you to acknowledge your character strengths, or it may be easier for you to admit your character defects. Either way, it will be essential for you to understand both if you are to live well within yourself.  When something is going wrong, look to your part. Avoid shifting the blame to others. Other people won't like it, and you won't learn anything. Talk to people you trust about your situation. Many times, a good friend will have insights into your motives that you yourself cannot discern. What do you want from your life? What are you doing to achieve what you want?   Make a list of qualities you would like to emulate in your life. Then, make a list of ways you can practice using these qualities in your daily life. Aristotle wrote, \"We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not a virtue, but a habit.\"If you want to be a kind person, do kind things. Learning to be honest about what you want is a difficult practice. Many people prevent themselves from having a good life by overemphasizing the things that they want but don't feel they can have because of other life circumstances - such as finances, family obligations, economic pressures, etc. This only perpetuates the myth that the person is a victim, a belief that is corrosive to happiness at all levels. If you don't know the big things of what you want out of life, start with smaller choices. Developing a sense of control and power over what you have in your life is essential to having a good life. Knowing the situations that you're afraid of will allow you to better see how these fears are constraining your life in ways that may not be immediately apparent. For instance, a fear of being called stupid may mean that you're not speaking up for yourself in your workplace, thus not being considered for a promotion.   Seeing your fears in writing will sometimes help you realize how useless it is to worry about things that aren't within your control. Sometimes a fear will be based in circumstances that are no longer present. Many people develop fears in childhood, when much was beyond their conscious control. But as an adult, the person has more autonomy and more power over their choices. By becoming more aware of the fears that drive your behavior, you can make more conscious decisions about the actions you take. No one is perfect. We all have short-comings, we all make mistakes and do things we'd rather not do. Mark Twain said, \"A man cannot be comfortable without his own approval.\" A good life isn't a result of making perfect choices, but of accepting the reality of who we are, including our limitations.  Self-acceptance is a discipline of honesty. It means that the person isn't denying their actions or inactions, or their consequences.  Self-acceptance is a practice of self-care. Much like any other expression of self-care, accepting yourself is a practice that must be consciously learned, and relearned as your characteristics change over time. To focus on the present, a practice sometimes called mindfulness, is a discipline that research studies have proven directly increase one's quality of life.  Notice when you are worried about the future, or regretting the past. Turn your attention to your breath. Count 10 breaths. Even as simple an exercise in mindfulness as this one can start to show positive effects in your life, when practiced over time. Cultivate daily habits, rather than setting distant goals. For instance, include exercise every day, rather than deciding to complete a triathlon in a month's time. Rather than deciding to lose 20 pounds, make a decision to eat healthily today. If you do decide to set a goal, break it down into manageable daily decisions.", "gt_summary": "Practice honesty within yourself. Examine your desires. List your fears. Cultivate self-acceptance.

This helps you see when you drive. Don\u2019t just clean off a hole that you can see out of. This can significantly decrease your visibility.  Clean off all windows and mirrors before leaving your home. You should also clean the snow off lights so other drivers can see your headlights, blinkers, and brake lights. Brush off your hood, trunk, doors, and roof. Snow can slide onto your windows and block your view, which won't be good when you're driving! It can also sling off and hit another car. Many states require by law that you remove all snow before getting on the road. You may be stressed and running behind, but your safety comes first! No matter how long you have been driving, you should drive slowly in winter weather. Even if you have winterized your car, you may still lose control of your car. By driving slowly and paying attention, you not only keep control of your car, but can be aware of those around you who many not be as careful as you. Press the gas and brake pedals gently. Speed up and slow down slowly and take it easy as you turn. Make sure to start braking early to avoid sudden stops. Stopping on wintry roads is very different than dry roads. You should not try to stop the same way you do on normal roads. That may cause an accident! Leave at least eight to ten seconds to stop. Gently press the brake with the ball of your foot and avoid slamming on brakes. If possible, take your foot off the gas pedal to slow down at red lights and try to roll to it until it turns green so you don\u2019t have to stop. You should double the distance you normally would between you and the vehicle in front of you. Keep scanning the vehicles in front of you and look out for brake lights. If you've kept your distance, you should be able to bring your vehicle to a stop with distance to spare instead of having to slam on your brakes and sliding into the vehicles in front of you. When you approach a hill, don\u2019t press the gas pedal hard to try to get up the hill. This can cause you to spin. Instead, try to use inertia to get up the hill. Don\u2019t stop on the hill because it can be difficult to get going again. If you have to press the gas pedal, do it gently and slowly. Skidding can be extremely scary! To correct for any skid, release the gas slightly and turn your wheels in the direction you want to go, very gently. Be careful not to over correct and do not press the gas until you are headed in the direction you want to go again.  If the car does not seem to turn, or turns too wide, easing off of the gas lightly might do. If that doesn't work, tap the brakes lightly and steer just slightly tighter into the corner. Simply panicking and steering sharply into the corner will only reduce control. If the car is hydroplaning, gently ease off of the gas without lifting off of it completely. If necessary, ease off completely. Cruise control can be a relaxing way to drive. However, during winter weather, you shouldn\u2019t use the cruise control on your car. This takes the acceleration and deceleration out of your control. On slippery surfaces that have snow, ice, or sand, this may cause you to slide or lose control of your car.", "gt_summary": "Clean off your car before driving. Drive slowly.

    "pred_summary": "Sperry shoes are known for their comfort and durability, but to ensure the perfect fit, it's important to try them on both sides of your usual size and to check for proper toe box and heel fit. Sperry recommends buying leather shoes a half-size smaller than your normal size, as they will loosen up with wear. For canvas or textile models, stick with your tried-and-true size. To enhance the comfort of a new pair of Top-Siders, spend some time working the material in different directions, and consider inserting shoe trees to prevent the shoes from returning to their original shape. Gently conditioning the leather with natural oils can also help protect the shoes from moisture and dry air. When checking for proper fit, look for loose threads or areas where the stitching has come undone, and snip or pull them off as needed. However, be careful not to cut any intact stitches, as this could cause the shoes to come apart prematurely.'"

It's best to pick herbs before the sun heats them up, but if you live in a place with mild sunshine, any time of the day may be appropriate. Avoid picking herbs that are damp as they can mildew easily. Wash dirty herbs gently but thoroughly and allow them to dry completely before freezing. Use frozen herbs within two months to avoid loss of flavor. Herbs kept frozen any longer than this may taste bland or unpleasant, depending on the type of herb.'\n\n\n\n\n"

Temporary filling materials are also available at pharmacies and can be used to address cavities until a permanent filling can be made by a dentist. It's important to visit a dentist even if there is no pain or sharpness, as they can provide a permanent and durable filling. A dental consultation can also prevent more serious problems from occurring.'\n\n\n"

    "pred_summary": "To stack the deck in your favor in a game of Poker, you can use a technique called \"riffle shuffling.\" This involves bending the top of the deck slightly to create a blind spot for the other players, and then using your thumb to slide the top card at an angle off to the side. Continue this process as you deal cards to everyone else, and then deal the top card to yourself. To avoid giving away your trick, keep the deck slightly tilted and hidden from view. Use an overhand shuffle to float the cards you want to the top of the deck, and then table shuffle the remaining cards to disguise your trick. Count the number of players in the game and place the appropriate number of cards between the cards you have stacked for yourself on top of the deck. This will give you an edge with the best starting hand without giving yourself away.'\n\n"

The more pages there are in the book, the more realistic the motion appears. There are several ways to make a flipbook, including stapling or binding sheets of paper together, using a notepad or pad of sticky notes. The images in the flipbook can be created in different ways, including drawing them by hand, taking photographs, or using digital video. The assembly of the flipbook involves arranging the images in a specific order, binding the pages together, and flipping through the book to create the illusion of motion. Professional animators use a similar technique to create animation by laying preliminary drawings one on top of each other and flipping through them to see the moving image.'"

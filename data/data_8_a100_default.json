[{"doc": "Ocular chemical burns can be very serious, so you need to take immediate action. If a chemical gets into your eyes, flush your eyes with water for at least five full minutes. You should always see a doctor for examination after a potential chemical burn to the eyes. He may add a 1% calcium gluconate solution to your eye-flushing routine. The doctor can also prescribe anesthetic eye drops to control your pain. If you wear contacts, remove them carefully when flushing out your eyes. Chemicals powerful enough to burn the skin can continue to work their way into deeper layers if left untreated. Thus, all chemical burns require medical attention. However, while waiting to see the doctor, the best thing you can do is hold the burn under cool (not cold) running water or soak it in a water bath. Remember that thermal burns are caused by heat, not chemicals \u2014 whether from the sun, steam, or a hot object. The first order of business in a first or superficial second-degree thermal burn is to lower the skin temperature at the burn site. Place the burned skin in cool (not cold) water for 10 minutes. If you don't want to waste running water, fill a sink or bathtub to submerge the skin. Either refill with cold water as the water warms up, or use ice cubes to keep the water temperature low. Just make sure that all the burned skin is either submerged in or under the flow of running cold water. Note that many experts advise against applying ice to a burn, as the dramatic temperature change can cause frostbite. Always cool the skin in water for at least 20 minutes if you want to apply ice to it. Simply seal the ice into a Ziploc bag with some water and wrap a rag or paper towel around it to create a barrier between you skin and the extreme cold. You can also use a bag of frozen vegetables out of your freezer if you don't have ice. Apply the ice for about ten minutes, rotating it around the burn site if it gets too cold.

Keep in mind that most men check out women\u2019s bodies without even thinking about it and women check out other women\u2019s bodies as well. Try to be as objective as possible about the situation to determine if there really is something to be concerned about.  For example, if your husband is casting a glance around a room and spending as much time looking at the men's suits as he is looking at the women's dresses, then he is not ogling. If your husband makes a comment that someone looks nice, and his comment is reasonable and not inappropriate (that is, he doesn't say she looks \"hot\" or \"sexy\"), it's likely not an issue to worry about. It is normal to notice when people look nice, especially when they go out of their way to dress up or get a new haircut. Consider, if you made a similar observation about a man, would your husband have cause for concern? \" If your husband is in fact checking out other women-- that is, his gaze is lingering across their breasts, hips, or butt, or he is making inappropriate comments or facial expressions while looking at them, this is not just normal guy behavior.  Keep in mind that it is disrespectful for your husband to ogle other women, especially in your presence. Some men who ogle women may do so because they were taught that manly men treat women badly. Therefore, it is possible that your husband is just doing what he thinks is expected of him. Men have higher levels of testosterone and testosterone controls the male libido, so noticing women\u2019s bodies is something that men are hard-wired to do. Staring, however, is a behavioral habit that can be changed.  Most men who ogle women developed the habit as teenagers, when their hormones were in overdrive. Looking at an attractive woman and feeling a sexual response gives a chemical response in the brain, which reinforces the behavior as pleasurable and contributes to a real habit that is hard to break.  Because it is a habit, it might be something that your husband does not even realize he is doing (like nail biting or nose picking). In that case, your husband might become defensive when you point it out, and may even shift the blame to you and accuse you of being jealous, insecure, or overly controlling. But luckily, because it is a habit, it is also possible for him to stop, provided he wants to stop. The key is to help him recognize when he is doing it and help him develop strategies to alter his behavior. It is easy to take it personally when your husband checks out other women, such as by feeling that you must not be attractive enough to keep his attention. But most men who behave this way do it no matter what their wives look like. Remind yourself that your husband is not looking at other women because of something you did. You should not feel like you have to be more attractive to keep his attention.

Typical descriptions of the type of pain include pressure, squeezing, tightness, and heaviness.  This pain may also result in a difficulty of breathing. Chest heaviness is often described as an elephant sitting on the chest. Some also compare the pain to that of indigestion. The pain may radiate from your chest to your arms, shoulders, jaw, or neck. It may also occur as primary pain in other areas such as your shoulders, arms, neck, jaw, or back. Women are statistically more likely than men to experience primary angina pain localized to an area other than the chest, or the chest pain may feel more like stabbing than pressure or tightness. Angina pain is caused by myocardial ischemia, which means reduced blood flow to your heart stops it from receiving enough oxygen. Because of this, you are likely to experience a range of symptoms in addition to the actual angina pain. Generally speaking, women are more likely to experience these additional symptoms, sometimes without even feeling typical chest pain. These symptoms include:  Fatigue Nausea Dizziness/fainting Sweating Shortness of breath Tightness in your chest You should immediately rest and stop putting any undue stress on your heart when you begin feeling a chest pain that you believe to be angina. Once you sit down and rest or take nitroglycerin, the pain should subside in a short amount of time\u2014around five minutes\u2014if you have what is called \u201cstable angina,\u201d which is the most common form. Stable angina is deemed as such because the causes and severity are usually both consistent and predictable\u2014at times when you force your heart to work harder.

If you\u2019re accustomed to monitoring symptoms of stable angina and your pain, the cause, the duration, or anything else deviates significantly from the norm, then you should seek immediate medical assistance because your angina has become unstable and could be a sign of a heart attack. Prinzmetal angina (or variant angina) is another form, but it\u2019s related to heart spasms that interfere with blood flow. This form of angina can be alarming because it also deviates from a predictable schedule and is very painful. However, medications are available to help control the heart spasms at the root of it.

Keep the outfit somewhat professional but also fun. A tank-top or sleeveless shirt can be a nice touch. Avoid jewelry, as this can be distracting.  Do your make-up how you usually wear it for an average. Take some extra time and apply carefully. Do not apply make-up heavily, as clumped mascara or smeared lipstick will show up in a headshot. Shiny eye shadow or lipstick can cause camera glare so it should be avoided.  Avoid cutting or dyeing your hair before a shoot. Wear it as you usually do.

They also mention a lack of experience is okay. Much of your training and learning will come after you've been hired.  An actor's resume is slightly different from a standard resume. As with a regular resume, list any basic contact information like your name, phone number, and address.  You should also list any special performing skills you have. For example, if you have professional vocal training, this is something to include.  You should list any performances you've been in, and include the time, location, and the roll you played.  Some actresses list their measurements, height, and weight on a resume. As Disney does have specific size requirements, this could be helpful information to include. Bring a copy of your resume with you to your audition. Keep it in a folder so it stays in good condition. You can find a list of auditions on the Disney auditions website.

As long as you meet these requirements, you can sign up to audition online. Disney princesses do not speak during auditions. You will imitate a Disney character and use gestures to communicate. The selection process is based on coordination, attitude, and movement.   Work on your smile. Disney princesses have to smile frequently on the job so spend some time practicing a smile before a mirror. It can help to record yourself moving and then study your form.

Writing down a shorthand account of what the speaker said will help you to organize the points when it\u2019s time to deliver your critique. Being as detailed as possible in your notes will help the speaker understand exactly what to work on for next time.  If there are no restrictions against it and you have time, record the speech using either a video camera or a tape recorder.

Deconstruct the speech by part, starting with the introduction and ending with the conclusion. Give an overall evaluation of whether you felt the main points of the speech were adequately presented and reinforced, and whether you felt the speech as a whole seemed convincing and credible. Would you consider it a successful speech, or does it need to be revised?  Tell the speaker what elements of the speech were interesting, which parts were confusing, and which areas need more references to back them up. If there were certain jokes or anecdotes that didn\u2019t work, let the speaker know. It\u2019s better to be honest now than to let the person tell the same bad joke twice. Tell the speaker whether you felt the speech was appropriate for the intended audience. It is in this area that speakers often need the most feedback, since it\u2019s difficult to evaluate your own body language and style. Give the speaker a gentle but honest critique of the effectiveness of his or her body language and delivery, including tone of voice, pacing, eye contact, and posture.  It might be helpful to discuss the concept of  emotional intelligence, or EQ, which refers to the ability to read an audience and keep people engaged by affecting their emotions. The point of making eye contact, speaking clearly and sounding natural is to make the audience feel as though you care about them and you want them to understand where you\u2019re coming from. Helping them feel included will make them more likely to stay engaged. If the speaker seemed nervous, you might suggest that he or she practice techniques that help reduce stage fright, like exercising before the speech, laughing before the speech and practicing in front of a small group of people first.

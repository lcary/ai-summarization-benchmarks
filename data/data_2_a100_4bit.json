This will prevent you from bending and flexing your wrist while you sleep.  You may want to wear a brace during the day as well, depending on what kinds of activities typically cause you pain. You can buy a brace at any drug store, or your doctor may suggest that you have a custom one made for you. Although it hasn't been definitively proven, sleeping on your side may be associated with a higher risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome. This is likely due to the fact that the wrist is more likely to be compressed in this position. If you sleep on your side, try sleeping on your back to avoid further compressing your wrist as you sleep. It's important to think about where you normally place your arms while you sleep and whether or not this may be worsening your symptoms. Try to avoid sleeping with either arm underneath you or your pillow, as this may worsen your carpal tunnel syndrome. Propping your arms up on pillows while you sleep may help relieve tension and reduce pain.  If you are sleeping on your side, make sure the side affected by carpal tunnel is on top. Place a pillow in front of you and place the affected hand on the pillow. You may need to experiment with the height of the pillow to find the most comfortable position for you. Bending your elbow may increase the compression on your nerve, which can make your symptoms worse. As much as possible, try to keep your elbow straight throughout the night.

If a startup is bought by a bigger company, you could potentially make a lot of money very quickly. However, be aware that 90% of startup companies last fewer than 5 years, which makes them risky investments.  Consider looking into different industries as well. If your original holdings are mostly in technology companies, try looking into manufacturing or retail. This will diversify your portfolio against negative industry trends. When you sell your stock (hopefully for a lot more than you bought it for), you should roll your money and profits into buying new stocks. If you can make a little money every day or every week, you\u2019re on your way to stock market success. Consider putting a portion of your profits into a savings or retirement account.

This can be a great time to buy stock in a company you believe will be successful, as the IPO offering price often (but not always) turns out to be the lowest price ever for a company\u2019s stock. The only way to make a lot of money in the stock market is to take risks and get a little bit lucky. This does not mean you should stake everything on risky investments and hope for the best, though. Investing should not be played the same way as gambling. You should research every investment thoroughly and be sure that you can recover financially if your trade goes poorly.  On one hand, playing it safe with only established stocks will not normally allow you to \"beat the market\" and gain very high returns. However, those stocks tend to be stable, which means you have a lower chance of losing money. And with steady dividend payments and accounting for risk, these companies can end up being a much better investment than riskier companies. You can also reduce your risk by hedging against losses on your investments. See how to hedge in investments for more information. Brokerage firms will usually charge fees for every transaction that can really add up. If you make more than a certain amount of trades per week, the Security Exchange Commission (SEC) forces you to set up at institutional account with a high minimum balance.

To extract tree resin, first find a conifer tree that generally looks healthy, with relatively smooth, tight bark and without many dead branches or limbs.  Conifer trees are trees that grow conifers, the cone-like growths that grow on tree branches. Examples of conifers are pine, spruce, maple and cedar trees. If you don't want to extract tree resin yourself, you can find it on Ebay or other online sites. Once you have found a suitable tree, use a machete or a hatchet to cut downward on the bark about 3 feet from the ground. Make a rectangle that is about 10 inches long and 6 inches wide. Try to cut cleanly so that you cut out a flat area about 1 inch deep into the tree. Place a bucket against the tree directly underneath where you made the rectangular indent. Use a flat piece of metal or another smooth material to make a ramp that leads from the cleared rectangle into the bucket. The ramp will catch the resin as it comes out of the tree and lead it into the bucket. Therefore, it's important that the ramp is flush against the tree and leads directly into the bucket. After you set up the bucket, use the hatchet or machete to hack into the cleared rectangle you made, forming V-shaped notches that are about half an inch from each other. It may be easier to do one side of the \u201cV\u201d at a time, hacking downward slashes on the left half of the rectangle and then hacking upward slashes on the other side of the rectangle. Collecting tree resin isn't instantaneous. You may have to wait several days for enough resin to collect. Keep the bucket under the tree and check on it daily. When it looks like you have about \u00bc cup of resin, remove the bucket from the tree and transfer the resin to a small bowl. It should take two to three days to collect \u00bc cup (60 ml) of resin.

Keep your arms straight by your ears as you lower them down to bring your head and torso down as well. Only lower your arms about halfway to the ground. Bring your back leg up while keeping it straight so your body forms a \u201cT\u201d shape.  This step requires balance.

Then put your other arm down so they're spread about shoulder width apart, similar to the way they would be positioned for a handstand. Place both hands along the imaginary line. Think \"hand hand feet\" to help you process the cartwheel.  For example, if you lunged with your right leg, place your right hand down first, then your left hand. Keep the fingers of each hand pointing away from your head. Straighten your front leg as you push so your legs end up in the air, pointing straight upwards. Balance your weight on your arms with your hands shoulder-width apart on either side of your head. Keep your head and torso upside down and positioned directly over your arms.  Use your shoulders and core for support. You won\u2019t hold this position for long. Cartwheels should be performed in one fluid motion. Make sure to keep your legs straight the whole time. If you are a beginner, then you may want to practice more. To complete the cartwheel, put your leading leg down first along your imaginary line. The first hand you placed on the mat will lift up naturally as your foot comes down. Bring your arm up by your ear to finish the cartwheel.  Your weight should start to shift onto your legs. Keep your head and torso roughly parallel to the mat. Your other leg will follow the first as it comes down. Make sure to place your back foot behind your leading foot along the same imaginary line so both feet point back in the direction you came from. Your second hand will lift naturally off the mat, following the first hand.  At this point, both your head and torso should be right side up, centered over your legs. A common mistake while cartwheeling is leaving your hands on the ground for too long.

For an older child, try bus numbers at a bus stop or the house numbers on a house. As the child becomes better at recognizing numbers, try phone numbers or car license plates. Most of the time, you use math on a day-to-day basis. Try thinking out loud when you find yourself using math to show your kids where math is relevant. Be sure to do this every day. For example, you could do the following:  Comparing prices at the grocery store. Measure ingredients for a recipe. Calculate coupon discounts. Shapes are important for understanding geometry. You can ask your child to name shapes as you run errands, as well as to name the shapes they play with. You can also do things like bake cookies with basic shapes, which combines learning and fun. Don\u2019t forget to incorporate 3D shapes as well!  There are lots of shape-based puzzles for younger children. They usually require the child to match a set of shapes or name different shapes. For an older child, try building a simple box out of paper and tape. Have them measure and cut all the pieces with a ruler and scissors. Point out shapes in the real world, such as octagonal stop signs and traffic cones. While direct questions are helpful in learning the basics of math, estimation questions require kids to think through a problem, not just spout out a basic answer. This tip works for both younger and older kids, but you may need to adjust the question.  For instance, an estimation question could be, \"How much water do you think will fill up this pitcher?\" Let your child try their hand at estimating, and then you can do an experiment to see how close the guess was. For younger kids, you might need to first show them how much a cup is. For older kids, you can try more complex questions, such as \"How long will it take to fill the bathtub with water?\"", "gt_summary": "Count with your kids. Work on number recognition.

This is especially important when picking out items for toddlers or young children, as small items may be a choking hazard.  If you need ideas related to a specific age group, such as babies, preschoolers, or middle schoolers, do a quick online search to find lists of suggested items. For example, a stocking for a baby might include a pacifier, holiday bib, or soft socks. A stocking for a preschooler could have things like animal finger puppets, a small doll, crayons, or bubbles. For children, these items could include practical things that they\u2019ll need like a small bottle of shampoo or toothpaste, as well as fun items like colorful chapstick or bath bubbles.  Headbands, hair clips, washcloths with pictures on them, and bath toys are also good options. Stuff their stocking with a small hat, gloves, or mittens for colder weather. Things like word search books, playing cards, and mini jigsaw puzzles are all great options for stocking stuffers. Make sure the games, puzzles, or books fit in the stocking and are age-appropriate so that the child can enjoy them.  Check the packaging or label on the item to see the age recommendations, if necessary. Other items might include comic books, Rubik\u2019s cubes, small games, or crossword puzzles. Pick out items like pencils, crayons, small watercolor sets, or stickers to put in the child\u2019s stocking. There are tons of fun craft supplies you can find that don\u2019t cost very much and are small enough to fill any size stocking.  Coloring books, small journals, stamps, and fun erasers can go in the stocking as well. Play-Doh or washable paints are great for younger kids. There are tons of toys you might include in the stocking, such as Legos, bubbles, bouncy balls, or wind-up toys. Visit your local toy store or big box store to find small toys perfect for a stocking. Small toy cars and slinkies are other great options. You can choose healthier foods, like oranges, apples, or nuts, or opt for holiday treats like gingerbread cookies, chocolates, or lollipops. It\u2019s a good idea to buy these items, especially candies, in bulk if you\u2019re filling more than one stocking.

Your temper might interfere with your ability to form friendships with others.  Learn to take control of your emotions and don\u2019t let them control you.  Before you say or do something out of anger, think about how you\u2019d feel if someone said or did the same to you.  Breathe in slowly through your nose, then exhale through your mouth for slightly longer than it took you to inhale. Find a positive outlet for your frustration and anger.  Go for a run or ride your bike.  Take up a martial art.  Any kind of exercise is a good way to blow off steam. Look for alternatives to violence, yelling, or other angry reactions.  In the end, these reactions will not solve the problem or situation that inspired them.  If someone said something rude to you, for instance, express your feelings in a mature way.

You owe me an apology.\u201d If your parents spend years acting as though your other sibling(s) are smarter, funnier, or more interesting than you, you might start to believe them.  Learn to identify self-defeating or critical thoughts and feelings and challenge them wherever possible.  The quickest way to disprove the lie that you have nothing of value to offer is to pursue your hobbies and interests.  Whatever it is you love doing, continue doing it.  The more your practice, the better you\u2019ll get.  After about 10,000 hours of practice doing something, you will have attained mastery in that particular hobby or skill.

Children who are bullied or neglected by their parents are vulnerable to exploitation by others who give them the attention and validation they crave.  Stay away from gangs, terrorist organizations, and cults, especially those that adopt a family-like structure.  As a child of parents who treat your siblings better than they treat you, you might be lured by promises of love and affection.  However, these arrangements are always temporary and designed with an eye on future benefits for the one who offers the apparent love and affection. Remember, real love is given selflessly, without any expectation of anything in return. If your parents treat your sibling much better than they treat you, you might come to see your sibling and your parents as part of a united conspiracy against you.  However, it is important to recognize that your parents alone are responsible for their behavior.  Your sibling has nothing to do with their attitude toward you.  Maintain a positive, healthy relationship with your sibling.  If your sibling is old enough to understand what\u2019s going on, talk to them about how your parents are mistreating you.  Seek their advice and encourage them to speak up on your behalf. Children of parents who show favoritism to another child often have a hard time in school.  Find a well-lit, quiet place to study.  Do all your homework each night, and use a daily planner to schedule time for yourself to review for tests, write essays, and complete important projects ahead of time.  Stay organized.  There are many apps available for your phone and tablet to help you better manage your time and keep track of your assignments.  The Complete Class Organizer and iHomework are among the best.

It protects the body by detoxifying hormones, drugs, and any biological molecules not produced in the human body. The liver also synthesizes cholesterol and proteins that might otherwise lead to clotting and inflammation. It stores vitamins, minerals, and sugar while removing bacteria.  The liver is involved in several important body functions, so it can become taxed by overuse. It's very important to return an overburdened liver to healthy enzyme levels to ensure all of these processes continue to function normally. Partly because the liver performs so many essential functions, it is prone to a number of different diseases. There are a wide variety of diseases that can cause your liver enzyme levels to shoot up:  Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH), also known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD): fats such as triglycerides and cholesterol accumulate in the liver. Hepatitis viruses: Hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E all have different causes. However, each different type of hepatitis infection taxes the liver. Other infections that burden the liver include mononucleosis, adenoviruses, and cytomegalovirus. Tick bites and parasites can cause harmful diseases like Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever or toxoplasmosis. Cancer that is often related to previous viral infections and liver cirrhosis Alcoholic hepatitis Jaundice Cirrhosis or the late-stage scarring of the liver Because the liver is involved in so many different processes, there is no single list of symptoms that point to liver disease. However, every liver disorder has both unique and shared symptoms.  If you experience any of these symptoms, speak with your healthcare provider immediately:  Yellowish skin and eyes that suggest jaundice Abdominal pain and swelling Swelling in the legs and ankles Itchy skin Dark yellow or reddish urine color Pale stools or bloody, tarry stools Chronic fatigue Nausea or vomiting Loss of appetite Weight loss Dry mouth, increased thirst A tendency to bruise easily See your doctor for a physical exam, and provide him with a complete medical history and description of your symptoms. The doctor will also order a Liver Function Test (LFT) analysis of a blood sample. The LFT will test for the levels of various liver enzymes and proteins.  Your doctor will use that information to aid in diagnosis. Some of these enzyme tests include:  AST (Aspartate aminotransferase): AST levels are analyzed to determine the likelihood of acute or chronic hepatitis.  ALT (Alanine aminotransferase): ALT is used to detect and follow the progress of hepatitis and liver injury. High levels are found in those with alcoholism, viral hepatitis, and diabetes. The ratio between AST/ALT levels is often used to tell if liver disease is due to infection, inflammation, or alcohol use.   ALP (Alkaline phosphatase): Can help diagnose bone disease, liver disease and gallbladder disorders.   GGT (Gamma-glutamyl transferase): With ALP, can be used to distinguish between liver and bone disease. GGT is also useful to help determine alcohol history; it is increased in about 75% of chronic alcoholics.  LD (Lactic dehydrogenase): LD (sometimes known as LDH)  is used along with the other LFT values to monitor treatment of liver and other disorders.  High levels are seen in various liver diseases, anemias, kidney disease, and infections. If you have a history of liver disease, you may need  liver tests every month or every six to eight weeks.  Keep track of the numbers carefully.  A downward trend in lab values over six to twelve months will indicate success in supporting the liver.

Anodized aluminum oxide is incredibly tough and resistant to corrosion. It is also porous compared to unoxidized aluminum, allowing it to absorb a variety of metal dyes.  The conversion process uses an electric current and a strong acid bath. The metal being anodized is connected to a circuit and placed in the acid bath where it acts as an anode (positive electrode). Negative hydroxide ions within the bath are attracted to the positive anode where they react with aluminum to form aluminum oxide. A scrap of aluminum is also placed in the bath, connected to the other wire. This serves as the cathode (negative electrode), completing the circuit. Aluminum is the typical metal of choice for this method, but other non-ferrous (non-iron) metals like magnesium and titanium can also be anodized. You will want to start by finding a space that you can work without causing any potential damage. You can gather these items individually, or you can purchase a commercial anodizing kit that should include everything you need.  Select your metal. Any aluminum or aluminum alloy can be anodized. Other types of metal, like steel, won't work. You will need three plastic tubs. Each tub should be large enough to hold your metal object. One will be used for the cleaning process, one for the acid, and one for the dye bath. Large, plastic paint buckets will work well for most jobs. Get a plastic jug to hold your neutralizing solution. For reagents, you will need sulfuric acid, baking soda, lye, metal fiber dye, and distilled water. Find an adequate power source. You will want a power supply that is capable of producing a consistent flow of electricity up to a minimum of 20 volts. A car battery is ideal. Get two power cables to connect the car battery to the acid solution. They should be strong enough to use to grip and lift the metal object in and out of the solutions. You will also want a spare piece of aluminum to act as the cathode in the solution. Have a large pot and stove to boil the metal object. Always wear a pair of large rubber gloves. Since you are handling strong chemicals you will need to handle your materials safely to avoid contact with your skin at all times. The neutralizing solution uses a baking soda base as an alkaline to neutralize the pH of the sulfuric acid. You should keep a neutralizing solution handy to neutralize sulfuric acid in an emergency and to clean equipment. If your skin should come in contact with the acid, always use the solution to neutralize the burn instead of making it worse with water. Add 2 cups (0.83 pt.) of baking soda to 1 gallon (3.79L) of distilled water. You can use any piece of aluminum alloy to anodize using this process. Put on a pair of rubber gloves before cleaning. Anything, even fingerprints, left on the surface can impact your results.  Clean the parts with water and dishwashing detergent. Immerse the parts in a bath of water and lye. Add 3 tablespoons of lye for each gallon of water. Using your rubber gloves, lower the metal object into the solution for about 3 minutes. Rinse the object in distilled water. If the water does not bead, the aluminum is clean. Add sulfuric acid to distilled water in a plastic container at a ratio of 5 parts water to 1 part acid.  Do not use a container that is breakable like glass. Always add acid to water so the solution doesn't fizz. Adding water to acid can cause it to splash up out of the container. With the power supply off, connect one cable to the positive output and the other cable to the negative.  Connect the other end of the negative cable to the metal object and submerge it in a container of sulfuric acid solution. Connect the other end of the positive cable to a scrap piece of aluminum and submerge it into solution without touching the metal object. Turn on the power. The voltage you use will depend on the surface area of the metal you are using. Check the power supply. Start with a low voltage of about 2 amps, then increase the voltage up to 10-12 amps after a few minutes. Anodize aluminum for 60 minutes. Negatively charged aluminum will attract positively charged sulfuric acid. You will notice a lot of bubbles around the piece of scrap metal, but very little bubbling around the metal you are anodizing. Be careful not to let any acid drip off the piece. You may want to the hold the container containing your neutralizing solution beneath the metal as you move it to the sink. Hold the metal beneath the water for several minutes while rotating to clean each side thoroughly. Prepare a solution of fiber dye and distilled water in portions to reach the color you want in a separate container. Follow any manufacturer instructions for the particular dye you have purchased. Depending on the desired color, you may only need to leave the metal in the bath for a minute or two. You can also gently heat the dye bath to help speed up the process. At first, you may have difficulty getting the precise color, so plan on trying out the process on a few practice pieces made of the same material first. The dye can be reused several times, so if you want you can store the dye in a plastic container after you've finished this dyeing session. Heat the water in a pot. Then immerse the object into the boiling water. The process will seal the dyes, but it will also cause them to fade slightly. This is another reason why it's a good idea to do at least one test piece first. Remove the object from the hot water. Set it on a towel to cool for several minutes.

You may not realize it but one way or another, someone feels so blessed with your existence.So stop saying you\u2019re nobody. Most of life is a choice, having the freedom to act and decide on your own.Start deciding and stop complaining. Rushing isn\u2019t all beneficial.Take time to smell the flowers.  Don\u2019t overdo yourself. Learn to appreciate life today, for tomorrow, you may not have the chance to do so. There are two types of people: proactive and reactive. The reactive always see the trouble and blames the circumstance to other people, while proactive see troubles as a bridge to success.  Which are you? One of the big disadvantages of a hurried lifestyle is the lack of meditation or reflection. We are too busy, too preoccupied.  But if you really want to find true happiness in this life, you have to be still, to quiet your mind so you can hear your heart. Knowing that life is imperfect gives you enough space to expect it to be hard.  You have to accept that life\u2019s circumstance is not ALWAYS within our control and all you can do is accept, understand and keep moving forward. Life is 99% choice and 1% chance. In times of affliction, it can be tough to see the lighter side.  But do always remember, that all storms have endings.  Just keep looking forward. A goal without action is nothing but a dream.It\u2019s very good to know what you want and set your plans.  However, if it\u2019s only written, it can\u2019t be realized.  You have to take action.  You have to wake up and stand up. Remember, life is 99% choice and 1% chance.We are in control of our life 99% of the time and yet a lot of us give this all to chances.  We let things happen instead of making it happen. One of the differences between achievers and non-achievers is the size of their dreams.  Big people achieve big dreams because they think big.  The same is true for small people.  They achieve smaller dreams because they think small.The key is to have confidence in oneself and think BIG! Worry is a complete waste of energy. Even how much you think about it over and over, it will not solve anything.  Worry gives you nothing but bad feelings. When faced with bad situations or problems, a lot of us leave it behind undecided.  We may think that the safest solution is leaving it to chances. However, indecision does not solve the problem, it just gives you temporary relief.  But sooner or later, you will feel its impact.  Most of the time, it\u2019s bigger than the original. Don\u2019t avoid problems, instead, be brave enough to face and solve it so you can move forward in life.  Stop being a coward! Instead of investing your time thinking of the problem, shift your thoughts on how you can solve it. People who seldom succeed in life are those who live in the shadow of the past. They cling too much of what they used to have that they seldom adapt and move forward in life. Remember that you can no longer alter what happened in the past but you can create your future.  Accept what happened and move on. Every day, you do the same thing, like a cycle that just goes round and round.  You get too lax that you find life too boring. But instead of focusing on the negative feeling of boredom, why not take charge and create a change. Sometimes, change does not only happen by surprise.  You have the capacity to create change. And why not do it now? Who knows, it might give you the big break you\u2019ve been dreaming of. Because no one else does. The only person that\u2019s burdened when you are too serious is you.  Keep a mature mind but a young heart.  Smile, you look better when you do. True friendship lasts forever.  You may not see them often but when friendship is true, even how time and distance separates you, true friends are the ones that stay with you. If you have found this type of friend, care and treasure them.  For it\u2019s one of the best gifts you will ever receive in your life. As long as you\u2019re alive, you have all the chance to achieve your goal. Don\u2019t get discouraged by past failures.  Keep striving. Remember, success comes from multiple failures. Those who win have finished the race. Have faith with your dreams until you achieve it. Nothing is impossible when you believe.

Living a healthy lifestyle can strengthen your immune system and make your body more resistant to illness. Make healthy habits part of your daily routine.  Eat a healthy diet. Make sure to get plenty of fruits and vegetables. Try to make sure that each meal includes several different colors. For example, include some leafy greens, a colorful fruit, and a healthy starch, such as a sweet potato. Don't forget the lean protein. Exercise regularly. Frequent exercise has amazing benefits to your health. It can lower blood pressure, cholesterol, and stress levels. Try to be active for at least 30 minutes a day, six days a week. Get plenty of sleep. Aim for at least 7-8 hours each night. Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time each day. This will help make sleep a part of your healthy routine. Try taking a daily vitamin C and zinc supplement to help prevent illness. You can even take a higher dose if you find that people around you have symptoms of illness. Keep in mind that it is okay to walk away from someone who is coughing to protect yourself. You can also move to a different seat if you are in a public place, such as on a bus or train. Germs are a fact of life. But you can take steps to minimize your exposure. For example, wipe down your work surface at the beginning and end of each day. Keep some sanitizing wipes in your desk for this purpose. Wash your hands. You should wash your hands with warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds several times a day. Wash after contact with animals, food, or after you touch your mouth or nose. Studies show that stress can actually make you ill. Not only does it cause health issues such as high blood pressure, but it can also manifest in tension headaches and upset stomach. To live your healthiest life, try to reduce your stress.  Take time outs when you need them. When you are in a stressful situation, give yourself permission to step away for a minute. For example, if you are fighting with your roommate about whose turn it is to clean the bathroom, excuse yourself to take a quick walk around the block. Make time for yourself.

Supply your garter snake with the right amount of space. A 5- to 25-gallon tank is appropriate, depending on the size of the snake. If there\u2019s not enough space, the snake will not be able to exercise and be unhealthy. With too little space, the garter snake will feel exposed. Give your garter snake with a \u201chiding box\u201d. A hiding box is a space where the garter snake can conceal itself. Consider putting in a plastic box or a hollow log for the snake to curl up into. Provide your snake with a water dish that is regularly refilled. This will give them water to drink as well as a way to stay cool. Keep your snake safe by making sure it cannot escape. Garter snakes are at risk in a home by other pets and humans. Also, a garter snake on the loose can frighten people who do not know if it\u2019s a venomous snake or not. These snakes eat a variety of food, but it\u2019s important to provide your snake with a good diet. Ideally, give them mice, but fish and earthworm are also good food for garter snakes. Avoid frogs and toads, since they can cause dangerous infections for garter snakes in captivity.  Mice provide garter snakes with a balanced diet. Not all garter snakes eat mice, so make sure yours is one that does. Otherwise, you\u2019ll have to keep in mind ways to balance the garter snake\u2019s diet. Earthworms are a particularly good diet for younger garter snakes. Cut them into smaller pieces, so they are smaller than the garter snake. They may not be able to eat full-size earthworms when they are younger. Fish can also be used for garter snakes. Frozen fish is best, since parasites will not be a problem. Don\u2019t give them fresh fish, since your garter snake may become infected. Avoid feeding your garter snakes frogs and toads. Though garter snakes eat frogs and toads in the wild, they are more resistant to the parasites in frogs and toads. Your pet garter snake will not be as resistant, so it\u2019s best to avoid them entirely. Garter snakes may make fun pets, but it may also be best to release them back into the wild. Make sure to bring them back to where you found them, so they will have the best habitat to return to. Also, always release garter snakes back into the wild during the warmest months.  Some garter snakes may refuse to eat in captivity. If this is the case, release your garter snake as soon as possible so it does not starve to death. If the garter snake is not adjusting to captivity, release them within a week or two. Keeping a garter snake too long can reduce its chances of survive in the wild. Bring garter snakes back to where you found them. They can easily find their way back to their habitat. Returning them to a foreign environment may make them less likely to survive.

If your office has graphic design personnel, consult with a typographer or a graphic designer if you are unsure which font will work best. your text to remove any errors or typos. Since infographics use different layouts and have several different text boxes, it can be harder to spot mistakes than it would be on, say, a press release. So, take the time to edit your own work: read the text to yourself and correct any grammatical or content-level errors. If you're working in an office environment, ask 1 or 2 coworkers if they'd be willing to review your writing as well. People are drawn to visuals, so draw the conclusions of your infographic in graphics, rather than text. Using custom illustrations can increase the popularity of your infographic.

Check with your hairdresser in advance to avoid disaster. Bleaching dark hair to blonde, especially platinum blonde or white, requires repeating the bleaching process multiple times with several days of rest in between. Don't expect to have gorgeous blonde locks immediately: you'll need to do this gradually. Since there will be intermediate stages when your hair is orange-tinged, coppery, or other not-quite-blonde colors, be ready to offset or mask these shades with hats, scarves, and other hair accessories. There are several choices in hair dye, and it is important that you choose the right one for your hair color.  Look for a bleach kit, which contains bleach powder and liquid peroxide. This is a stronger formula suitable for dark hair. Peroxide comes in different strengths, ranging from 10 volume to 40 volume. Note that 40 volume is too strong for general bleaching as it could burn the scalp. It is only used for tipping dark hair, in which case it does not come in contact with the skin. 30 volume will work more quickly than either 20 or 10 volume. This is crucial: it lets you see how long you need to let the dye sit in your hair to achieve the desired shade. Always read and follow the manufacturer's instructions for a strand-test included in the bleach kit. In general the steps are as follows:  Snip a few strands of hair from an inconspicuous place at the back of the head. Tie the strands together with a bit of string or tape them together at one end. Mix a small amount of the bleach powder and liquid peroxide per manufacturer's instructions. Dip the strands into the bleaching mix so that they are completely saturated. Set a timer or keep track of how much time passes during the test. Every five minutes, check the strands by wiping away the bleach with an old cloth. Reapply the bleach again, and repeat the process until you have the desired shade of blonde. Now you know how long to leave the bleach in your hair. Before you bleach, massage unrefined coconut oil into your hair and scalp. This helps protect your hair from excess damage during the bleaching process. Leave it in for 14 hours for maximum benefit.

Talking trash about you behind your back. Throwing unwarranted cruel language and insults your way at every opportunity. Acting rude to you, but being very kind to others. Also, if he/she suddenly acts angry or annoyed around you when he/she didn't seem to be before, that's a sign that they don't like you. Just be straightforward and ask them. 90% of the jerks harboring hateful feelings won't have much to say back to you -- they're just angry people. When confronted, they'll stammer, hem, and haw, because there is usually no good reason to hate you. But, if they do respond, you'll have a chance to make things right:  If they are uncomfortable, just flash them your pearly whites and say, \"It's all right. Let's just try and be better friends in the future.\" If that seems a bit condescending, you can go with, \"I understand if you'd rather not talk about it. I just noticed that you don't seem to like me and was curious.\" If they tell you a reason why, say \"That's good to know.

If they don\u2019t, at least you tried to be mature about the situation.  Be direct without being pushy. For example, say one of your coworkers hates you because you backed into his car a few weeks ago. \"Listen, I'm really sorry about your car. I made a mistake, and I shouldn't have been so careless. I feel horrible, and I want to find a way to make it up to you.\" If you still don't know what caused the problem, say something like, \"Hey, I'm not sure what's up, but I've noticed that you're kind of upset with me. I hope I haven't done something to piss you off. What's up?\" In fact, this is a good thing! If you're living your life and staying true to yourself, you're not going to get along with all seven plus billion people on the planet.

The advantage of going to a wine tasting is that you can try several kinds of wines without committing to buying a bottle you may not enjoy.  Some wine tastings have small refreshments for cleansing your palate in between wines as well as buckets for spitting out wine so you don\u2019t accidentally drink the equivalent of a whole bottle. Don\u2019t take advantage of your host. The goal is to taste new wines, not get drunk. Wine tours are popular throughout the world and they\u2019re a great way to learn about the process of making wine and all of the details that go into a simple glass.  Come prepared to walk the grounds of the vineyard and remember to stay hydrated. Look into the fees and prices. Sometimes if you buy a bottle during the tour, some of the costs may be waived. Go with a group. It can be more fun and may be cheaper as well. Oftentimes a review or the wine bottle label will recommend different cheeses or meats to consume with the wine you\u2019re drinking. Eating and cooking is simply balancing the aspects of fats, acids, salt, and sweet tastes. Wine pairings are a great excuse to make a meal centered around a certain red wine and steak and inviting your friends over to try it.  Some wines are best paired with foods from the same region. For example, a wine from Northern Italy may pair best with a goat cheese from a farm in the upper regions of Italy. Pairings are helpful because you may not like wine for its acidity, but if you know that eating a sweet fruit with it helps to balance the flavors, you may enjoy it more. You don\u2019t have to learn all of the lingo that wine experts use, but pay attention to how they talk about a wine\u2019s aromas and tastes. Just by listening you might gain a deeper appreciation for a certain variety or grape or production method.  Your friends and family are also good gauges. If you share similar tastes, ask them for a recommendation and why they prefer a particular type. At the very least, learn to pronounce the names of the various types of wines. Wine is appropriate for all sorts of events and places and different wines suit different settings and even seasons of the year. You may find that you prefer to drink wine instead of a beer at sporting events or enjoy wine with dessert only.  A sparkly or sweet wine may be best for a celebration and a dark red might better suit an evening at home with a good book. Some people agree that chilled wines are best for warm summer days and warm, mulled wines are best for long nights in the winter. Your taste buds change all the time and you may find that a wine you couldn\u2019t stand before is now your favorite.

Prior to having a discussion for children of any age, review information about menstrual cycles. Read materials written specifically for kids.

You may want to check out a book on menstruation written specifically for children or share it with your boys. If the boy you're speaking with already has an understanding of where babies come from, this part will be easy.  If he doesn't, it might be a longer conversation.  Explain to him that every woman has a \u201cbaby center\u201d called the uterus, which allows her to grow a baby.  Each month, her body gets ready to hold a new baby. To do this, her uterus has to get extra strong, so it grows a lining.  For example, a mother might say to her young son, \"Every woman has a uterus, which is where babies grow until they are ready to come out.  Every month, her body gets ready to have another baby and the lining of of uterus gets really thick so that it can catch an egg and hold on to it.  If it's time to have a baby, the baby will grow inside the uterus.\" If he is having trouble understanding the concept, you might say the uterus is like a balloon inside a woman\u2019s tummy. By age 5, children should be comfortable with the official names of reproductive organs. If a woman doesn\u2019t have a baby inside, the uterus no longer needs the thickened lining created that month.  The lining dissolves and is dispelled through the vagina as blood. The mother could continue with something like, \u201cIf a woman doesn\u2019t want to have another baby, this extra strong lining in the uterus goes away because she doesn\u2019t need it.

If you are staying in your same industry but are hoping to move down on the totem pole, consider rewriting your resume so that it only contains the skills and experience that are relevant to your specific job. You can consider leaving out more demanding or prestigious positions you have held if they do not particularly apply to the position. Doing this will help you to avoid being labeled \u201coverqualified\u201d. If you are thinking about making a move into a completely different industry, you should tailor your essay so that it reflects all of your transferable skills (skills that you picked up in your current industry that also apply to the industry you are applying to). Again, only focus on experience that is relevant to the job, even if it means leaving out more prestigious experience. Applying to several different jobs at once can help increase your chances of getting hired. While it can be time consuming, tailoring your resume and (if needed) cover letter to the specific job you are applying for is very important. Take time to very carefully read the job description and write your cover letter based on what is listed in the description. If you are requested to appear for an interview, think of it as both a step towards getting a job, and a way to make sure that the company is compatible with your reasons for downsizing. Make sure to bring a copy of your important documents, like your resume or examples of your work. When going to the interview, dress in clothes that are suitable for the job role; business casual is standard, unless the company is very prestigious, or you are applying for a job that requires you to wear a specific set of clothes (like hiking boots for the position of a park ranger). If the job you are interviewing for is significantly less challenging or demanding than your last job, it is important to explain your reasons for applying, particularly if the salary is also much less. Sharing your personal reasons will help your potential employer to understand. For example, discussing the fact that you want to spend time with your kids, or would prefer to work in a less stressful environment, will help the interviewer to understand your reasons. Be gracious in your interview and take care not to come across as \u2018overqualified\u2019 or like this job is beneath your skill levels, as  it most likely won\u2019t impress the employer if they think you are looking at this as an easy job or \u2018a step down\u2019 from your current position.
